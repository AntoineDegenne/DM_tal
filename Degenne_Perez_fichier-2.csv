21,you ve heard all the hype you ve seen all their face natali portman the profession as queen amidala liam neeson schindler s list as qui gon jinn ewan mcgregor trainspot as obi wan kenobi and jake lloyd jingl all the way as young anakin skywalk if you ve read ani review you ve also probabl heard that thi movi fail to live up to the magic and human of the first trilog you also may have heard that thi one s too kiddi friendli and doesn t have enough content for adult believ the hype the effect are stun the digit creatur are amazingli realist the lightsab duel are amaz and queen amidala s sumptuou robe are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth but there s someth miss here and it isn t budget or effect it s everyth money can t buy the actor struggl as best they can to flesh out broad stroke and flat charact the most success at thi is liam neeson who as qui gon jinn a jedi master to young obi wan kenobi ha quiet digniti and a wise command presenc he is the anchor to thi movi as he is the one charact who georg luca appar spent some time flesh out portman s queen amidala and mcgregor s obi wan kenobi don t fare nearli so well amidala the futur mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peac planet be invad by the trade feder come off as stoic stilt and caricatur it appear as though she wa a vulcan geisha in a former life and obi wan although mcgregor make him veri endear ha so littl screen time that he s noth but a robin to qui gon jinn s batman howev mcgregor doe struggl man to infus thi surprisingli small support role with a spark of genuin insight and human and he doe a good job he also absolut nail alec guiness obi wan in episod scottish accent and that realli make hi presenc in the film more profound than it might have been otherwis in fact luca seem to bank on that preexist knowledg quit a bit and that s one of the problem with thi film i would never call myself a star war fan especi not consid what it mean to be a fanat these day but i ve alway enjoy the film along with everyon els in america howev if you are the one person in america who hasn t seen the film at all or even recent or who doesn t bother to brush up on the name of obscur charact you may be hopelessli lost for exampl one of the film s main nefari charact is senat palpatin for those of you not recent steep in star war trivia emperor palpatin is that scari hood apparit who wa darth vader s master in return of the jedi and empir strike back so obvious hi appear in phantom menac is meant to stir some echo of hi later role in the seri thu make hi role here more meaning a lot of the movi is like that r d and c po make token appear and it s obviou that luca is bank on the audienc s pre exist fond for them becaus he doesn t do much to add to it in ani way same goe for jabba the hutt who doesn t look as much mean here as he doe corpul and lazi even planet make foreshadow guest appear in thi film tatooin the desert world where luke grew up corusc the cloud citi from empir strike back and alderaan leia s home planet which we never actual see that get blown up in star war show up or are mention briefli in pass what s the result of tie so mani plot point and charact to futur film the answer is that thi one seem surprisingli empti there s no meat no substanc that make you want to love the charact as they are not as they will be anoth problem is that there are actual too mani alien charact in the film i wa distract by the fact that two of the main evil charact strang look alien who look like gila monster had mouth that bare move make them look more like muppet than actual charact and jar jar bink a silli roger rabbitish amphibi charact is intend as comic relief but what he realli becom is annoy and fast unlik chewbacca and c po who got their human if you ll pardon the express from their interact with the human charact jar jar is often left to interact mostli with other of hi kind at time make the movi seem like noth more than a veri expens teenag mutant ninja turtl furthermor the dialogu is often stilt and corni and sometim downright infantil therebi render some charact into noth more than bystand to the plot oddli thi isn t just my judgment luca ha said that he design thi film for kid well he s done a good job the hero of thi film of cours is young anakin but it wa veri hard for me to feel ani kinship or identifi with an eight year old boy that s not jake lloyd s fault though he doe a good job of be a cute kid which is appar all luca ask of him that s anoth mistak of cours becaus the cute tyke becom darth vader warn spoiler ahead in my opinion there wa not nearli enough foreshadow of anakin s futur evil in the film the boy is all blond flow hair and rosi cheek and there s noth more than a spark of aggress in him throughout the entir movi he ha a dote mother pernilla august make her first english languag film and is a slave to a gross fli gnome on tatooin but the onli indic the audienc get that thi kid isn t all heart and rose is yoda s hesit in allow him to train as a jedi under qui gon jinn hi explan hi futur is cloud warn major spoiler ahead enter at your own risk of cours the nobl qui gon die at the hand of darth maul a scari look sith lord who excel at the jedi art but ha turn to the dark side thi dude ha mayb two line in the entir movi but he establish hi presenc through hi amaz move with hi doubl side lightsab and hi scari facial makeup becaus qui gon never get a chanc to train the young anakin in the way of the forc obi wan qui gon s young padawan apprentic one level below knightdom must take over the train himself so at the end of the movi we end where the saga actual begin with obi wan kenobi and hi young apprentic anakin darth vader skywalk did thi stori need to be told i would say no but is it a worthwhil movi to see absolut if you don t enter the theater with jedi size expect and you simpli want to be treat to an enjoy visual spectacl then thi is your movi the tatooin pod race are a triumph of effect and comput anim the digit background on some of the planet are an astonish sight and yoda and young obi wan are worth see for their origin in a simpler happier time abov all thi is a fun movi not deep not meaning and not profound but fun mayb next time luca will hire lawrenc kasdan to co write the script and the guy who direct empir will direct becaus if luca doe the next one himself it will be lack the one thing it need the most potenti ,1,1

like just the sort of thing that would of cours onli add more fuel to the farrelli brother fire prove that some peopl just couldn t take a joke and that the farrelli would be help the more enlighten viewer to yet anoth dose of their brilliantli subvers comedi ye it all seem perfect but one thing went wrong their movi isn t funni it s not for lack of tri the farrelli util in me myself iren their most high concept premis ever carrey play charli baileygait a man who after be dump by hi wife for a midget limo driver decid to buri all hi aggress feel deep down insid and never releas them thi of

he s been insult or hold a littl girl s head underwat becaus she refus to stop jump rope in the street then thing start get lost in the most complic plot the farrelli have ever attempt and the film run off it track some have suggest that thi isn t a problem becaus the farrelli brother brand of humor doesn t requir plot to work they re wrong of cours plot wa greatli instrument in build up the kind of rollick comic energi that infus the farrelli last effort s there s someth about mari s outsid provid wa technic an earlier project the brother earlier film wasn t funni mere becaus it contain outrag gag despit what some newsmagazin articl would have you believ but rather becaus it most outrag gag were entir unexpect in mari the farrelli manag sever time to pull off a neat sleight of hand trick they d have you think the stori wa go one way then reveal it real direct in delight surpris fashion me myself iren by contrast seem to have been made by folk who look at mari and saw onli the surfac gross miss all of the subtl machin that realli made it work have been produc by the same guy who made mari iren seem like an even bigger disappoint the brother pile on the offens humor take shot at race midget albino mental ill and all manner of bathroom joke but they haven t come up with a way to make ani of it fresh most of me myself iren come off as rote by the number adolesc comedi the plot with carrey forc to drive alleg fugit iren p water rene zellweg who s in more troubl than anyon know back to new york ha an end that s entir predict from the get go think charli and iren will fall in love yeah me too the farrelli then introduc score of differ charact and none of them ever manag to do anyth you haven t alreadi expect them to do no matter how outrag their action might be compar to the curvebal the farrelli are use to throw thi stuff is almost entir soft toss present an obviou problem when gross out humor lose it shock valu it s no longer funni mere gross the joke that do work are milk over and over until their effect run dri take for exampl the subplot involv charli s three black son anthoni anderson mongo brownle jerod mixon the incongru of it all is funni for a while with three burli black men discuss higher math in ghetto languag and white bread carrey mouth said languag with an entir too pleasant smile on hi face but by the end of the film they re still do the same schitck it hasn t been elev to anoth funnier level and it hasn t been drop either that s too bad becaus it ceas to be amus about halfway through me myself iren reek of wast opportun there ought to be more focu on how other peopl react to charli s new person and on how charli deal with the consequ of hank s action thi doesn t realli happen nearli everi support charact learn about charli s condit earli on so they don t have ani opportun to be surpris by it the film throw what look like a patent farrelli curv in a scene toward the midway point involv an albino companion charli and iren pick up call appropri whitey but the script doesn t go anywher with it instead leav the thread twist in the wind befor awkwardli tie it up dure the climax jim carrey is a gift comedian both physic and vocal but he s left with noth much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in all of me it s a great showcas of flexibl and split second role shift but none of it is terribl funni carrey doesn t pull ani stunt we don t expect him to pull and the farrelli script doesn t give him anyth els to pull the situat in which he must perform the role shift aren t set up in ani meaning way perhap carrey can take solac in the fact that hi support actor fare no better zellweg s iren is not a strong femal lead mari in mari may have been part adolesc fantasi but she wa also intellig and strong will iren is noth in particular as the film never make clear whether she s ditzi clever or neither as such she give us noth to latch onto as the onli sane person in the film chri cooper is stuck play exactli one note as a corrupt fbi agent and hi charact is entir too straight lace for a movi like thi he like the other doe absolut noth unexpect after view the shapeless mess that me myself iren eventu dissolv into i wa stuck wonder whether or not the farrelli had outsmart themselv mayb their kind of comedi can onli work for so long until audienc get wise to it and stop be shock but i don t believ it good filmmak find way of surpris their audienc even after peopl have grown attun to their style if the farrelli are inde good smart filmmak and i still think they are they

48,robert redford is veri good at play charact who have incred god given gift but are abl to act like ordinari peopl in the natur he play the fallen angel charact of roy hobb the basebal player who wa destin to be the best there ever wa but still act like a humbl farm boy in butch cassidi and the sundanc kid he wa the most danger shot in the west yet he came off like a noth more than a boyishli good look charmer even in indec propos where he play a man who wa so good at make money that he believ he could buy love redford wa still abl to exud an aura of shi decenc especi when recit a tale of lost love in hi latest film the hors whisper base on the best sell novel by nichola evan redford again play such a charact redford also direct the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movi i suppos the charact of tom booker a man who ha the amaz gift of understand and somehow commun with hors wa just too good to pass up despit hi enorm and rare gift when it come to train troubl hors a magazin articl coin the phrase hors whisper to describ hi uncanni talent booker see himself as an everyday cattl rancher whose greatest fear is grow old and no longer have a purpos in life booker s talent are tax into servic by anni maclean kristin scott thoma a new york magazin editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson wa recent in a horribl accid the accid which is film with gut wrench horror happen when grace and her best friend are out ride hors an eighteen wheeler kill grace s friend sever wound and traumat grace s hors pilgrim and caus grace to lose part of her right leg anni believ that if pilgrim can be heal grace will be heal as well which lead her to booker at first she tri to get booker to come to new york to see the hors but that doesn t work instead she pack up grace and pilgrim leav her husband robert sam neill behind and head for the roll hill of montana where booker run a ranch with hi brother frank chri cooper and hi sister in law dian diann wiest in mani way the film is like a journey both liter and symbol the move out west ha alway been a great american tradit of renew and it s hard not to see anni and grace s leav manhattan for montana as a variat on the classic theme of citi vs countri in the hors whisper countri is clearli the victor the citi is character by claustrophobia and unhappi and it is not until the charact arriv in the wide open space of montana that grace s anger at be physic and emot crippl begin to dissip anni s control natur begin to relax and pilgrim onc again learn to trust peopl redford is just as in love with the grand montana countri in thi film as he wa when he direct a river run through it six year ago in mani way the hors whisper come from the same poetic vein as river and the movi could probabl be a good fifteen minut shorter if redford had decid to spend less camera time on the grass and mountain but then that would ruin the magic much of the film s photographi is truli eleg and it creat a palpabl sens of the sheer expans of the land to further emphas thi redford and cinematograph robert richardson natur born killer platoon cheat a bit by shoot the begin of the film which take place in new york with mostli cold harsh bluish filter and a more squarish aspect ratio when the action shift to montana richardson switch to soft focu and natur light and the screen widen to a aspect ratio in term of the stori itself the hors whisper give us the same romantic view of adulteri found in david lean s a brief encount and clint eastwood s adapt of robert jame waller s the bridg of madison counti richard lagravenes co screenwrit here also adapt bridg although the hors whisper ha a strong romant sensibl i still find someth oddli troubl about thi kind of stori it seem to me that there should be some sympathi for the husband who s be left behind for thi brief heart sweep affair but there rare is in the hors whisper the thankless role of be the fuddi duddi husband fall to sam neill he play the charact as a decent hard work man who is a good husband and father hi onli failur is that he love hi wife more than she love him he is at risk of lose anni to booker not becaus he did anyth to drive her away but simpli becaus he happen to be a normal fairli uninspir man there is one scene that is particularli tell of how the movi feel about each charact it show booker and robert go into a hors pen booker is dress like a classic cowboy with hat and all while robert look somewhat frumpi and out of place in a basebal cap as they enter the pen booker assuredli swing over the fenc while robert hesit then open the gate and in a goofi moment forget to close it behind him it s a small scene but it clearli demonstr the movi s thorough love of the booker charact for hi romant rough after all booker repres everyth good about the citi while robert repres everyth banal and unnatur about it the best scene in the hors whisper tend to involv not the build romanc between booker and anni but rather the heal process of grace and her hors although booker s hors train method are mythic and unrealist the scene with him and pilgrim are strang mesmer these are parallel by the scene between him and grace some of which are humor and all of which are tender and true at some point i wish the movi would drop the whole romanc angl and focu on grace more nevertheless redford is obvious a romant at heart and he bring a light touch to the erot moment in the film there are no dramat sex scene but there is a move scene when he and scott thoma are slow danc alway move ever closer togeth that is far more erot than ani scene of sweati bodi grind togeth although the movi is longer than it should be and is essenti a melodramat tearjerk with an unsatisfi conclus that guarante unhappi for just about everi charact there are enough moment like that which make the hors whisper worth the price of admiss ,1,1

these problem paradox by not cronfront them it doesn t simpli plug in the right thing at the right time it creat an entir realiti where everyth make sens and said concern are irrelev build a strong foundat is import to all form of media without which what is there to build on we re given some backstori here and learn a littl about our charact especi our main charact scarlett o hara leigh a beauti southern bell with a will of steel a cun wit and a tremend sens of liberti in such an oppress time she know how her societi work wherein everyth she doe can and will play a role in the shape of her life and those around her right from the begin we realiz how determin she is to have her way no matter what the consequ may be be the most sought after woman allow her to manipul men and their women to ensur she get her way whether it be obviou i e who will be the one to get her food or subtl i e get marri just to spite someon the man she claim to love is ashley wilk howard a modest gentleman who doe not seem to have the same passion for her as she doe for him he isn t so arrog and demand as scarlett in fact he s engag to a woman with a person much more like hi her name is melani de havilland and she is one of the sweetest kindest and most likabl charact one will ever see she and scarlett becom veri dear friend but she never suspect the jealous scarlett ha for her and the love she ha for her husband her meek is both her strongest and weakest characterist it defin who she is but doesn t give her much emot self defens act a catalyst to the love triangl and to the stori as a whole is the daper stong will cun cocki southern busi and militari man captain rhett butler gabl he s quit a charact all right everyon listen to what he ha to say even though he s got a bad reput butler make no apolog for hi vast amount of money nor hi behavior he tell everyon the much need truth in the rigid cast like societi where freewil doesn t seem to exist everyth is done out of honor and tradit for exampl in hi first appear butler tell hi fellow southern there s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out thi anger them not for hi lack of faith but becaus he ha the gall to say it aloud and boast at that do we have ammunit factori do we have food do we have a navi all we have is tobacco all true statement and yet the south still insist he s wrong butler is a shifti charact to be sure but he take such pride in hi arrog it s appeal scarlett notic thi too when she first see him and from the look butler give her we know he s not go to stop until he ha her but scarlett can t get past her need for ashley and dure a scene which set the stage for the grand stori butler learn of thi and continu to throw it back at scarlett forev and so the stori goe on with scarlett be thrown obstacl after obstacl in her life the conflict she must overcom rang from take care of her entir famili to find a proper husband especi after she is mark for life when her first husband die thi give the film mani opportun to bring in more charact into the epic stori some are vital for onli a few scene but their true signifc will endur throughout the film in most film onli a few charact exist for support in background but thi film is more realist and believ as it incorpor a support cast the size of a small town and everyon ha signfic even peopl in the background seem more than just extra wander the set the costum design is outstand so that the film make for a real sens of time and place the filmmak could have easili set more scene indoor and narrowli focus to avoid have to show the outsid real world but these type of simpl approach are never taken the first half of the film depict the traumat experi the south face at the last day of the civil war fleme is abl to convey the horror of it all by paint an imag of destruct and let the viewer decid just how bad it is one scene ha scarlett work as a nurs at a militari hospit while we hear a soldier in the background scream no not my leg don t cut off my leg anoth scene show her simpli tri to cross a street but as the camera pull back we see that her path is block by hundr of wound soldier but it is their moan that s more graphic than all the bloodi gore could ever be as the second half begin the film concentr more on scarlett as a complet independ woman who singl handedli take care of her famili and melani just to spite the tyrani of the north she manag to resurrect the famili plantat but all the willpow she ha can t help her when she must pay exuberh tax set by the north after the south s ultim defeat thi bring rhett butler back into the pictur and thu begin their torrid love hate relationship most of the second half of the film is somehow relat to the relationship or lack thereof between rhett and scarlett each use the other for person gain but at the same time they still feel an intim connect with each other scarlett continu to use her manipul power over men to get what she want and becaus rhett can t help but want her more everi time she tri to one up him such as marri anoth man and take over hi busi they say opposit attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goe way beyond oppos person it border on magnet polar they need each other and know thi yet they never seem truli happi togeth perhap they mistak love for passion and the film leav it up to us to make thi call both have thing the other want and vice versa but when they compromis is it just to get their own way or becaus they actual care for each other love and the percept of love are two complet separ thing and throughout the final act of the film we re left wonder if rhett and scarlett ever truli love each other and whi gabl and leigh do have great chemistri alway leav the viewer wonder which emot were

54,capsul the much anticip re adapt of the pierr boull novel come to the screen as a dark and a littl dreari film with lot of chase and fight but veri littl intellig visual there is much to like about thi version but the approach is to take an adventur after the style of gulliv s travel and treat it as an action film that make it a film without much center to pierr boull author of the bridg on the river kwai wrote planet of the ape a k a monkey planet the novel as a social satir it read a lot like a fifth book of gulliv s travel human discov a planet in which the role of ape and human have been revers not unlik the role of hors and human on jonathan swift s island of the houyhnhnm the novel move somewhat slowli to creat some suspens in reveal all the thing most film fan know to be true about the natur of the planet it seem to me there is also a statement about human cruelti to anim but perhap i wa just look for that when rod serl adapt the novel into a film releas in he ad a number of serl touch familiar from episod of the twilight zone and chang the end to make it more serl ish the final ironi of the origin version ha becom film histori without it there could never have been a planet of the ape film seri i can surmis onli that serl ran into seriou script problem in how to handl the tricki question of languag in the book the ape had their own languag and the human eventu learn that languag that could have been done in the film but that would have requir the entir film to be subtitl for the non ape speak serl avoid thi by have the ape speak english and of cours there is some justif for that by the end of the film justifi whi the ape spoke english may have even been the inspir for hi surpris end but serl never tackl the all import question of whi a supposedli intellig human never show ani curios or even surpris that the ape speak hi own languag a languag they had no opportun to ever hear few viewer question thi seriou plot hole howev and the film ha becom well respect in cinema histori partial credit at least should go to jerri goldsmith whose extrem invent score is one of goldsmith s best if not hi best when the film s success call for sequel the filmmak turn up the violenc and they ad well intent though not veri subtl polit messag about what wa happen in the unit state of the s and s while the first film had a littl shoot of gun and what wa there seem a littl half heart by the second film beneath the planet of the ape there wa a good deal more violenc and from that point on the seri had a lot of violenc and chase the seri conclud with battl for the planet of the ape in now director tim burton tri hi hand at adapt the origin book again for those who thought that the version wa not veri faith to the book burton s new version is even less faith first he doe not realli revers the role of the human and the ape he ha them both be intellig articul race battl for a domin of the planet current in the hand uh make that paw of the ape that could be a good stori too but it is not planet of the ape as with the mission imposs film and so mani other cinemat homag to the third quarter of the last centuri the titl make promis that the

wizard of oz fashion and drop him on an alien planet ye he surviv thi storm but then no storm is perfect he quickli find not greatli to ani surpris he show that on thi planet ape rule and human drool but everybodi talk and the languag they talk is earth english appar it doe not even occur to leo that there is a mysteri that need to be explain about that the fact it doe not occur to leo and appar didn t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of thi film both just assum that if ape were go to talk the languag they would speak would be english in ani case have one talk race domin anoth make thi not a look at human anim relationship and more one of the master slave relationship outsid of sudan and a few other countri thi is a less relev topic leo is captur to be use as a slave but also is discov by ari play by helena bonham carter ari is an attract ape with close tie to high polit power she is bent on make the world a better place perhap in a previou draft of the

thi point forward it is not long befor leo escap with some human and onli a coupl of sympathet ape thi is a further abandon of the sourc materi the chase sever limit the interplay of ape and human and the examin of each s place in thi revers societi each import in the book we can not see how the societi work becaus most of the screentim societi ha broken down we see the human either separ from the ape or fight them burton choos viscer thrill over cerebr one at almost everi turn thi is a miscalcul as charact so lack in empathi valu are difficult one to place much emot invest in they are basic chess piec and the viewer ha littl reason to root for them to win the script had littl subtleti with line like i never met an ape i didn t like but at least we care for what happen to taylor the main charact most of what thi film ha to offer is in the visual the visual work is spotti but gener nice done except that so much of the film take place in the night or in fog thi tend to limit close look at the makeup in gener it seem much improv from the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chamber who did it for the version in chamber makeup wa a jaw dropper it wa realist enough to almost be believ but flexibl enough to show emot chamber is good but if anyon had a chanc to best him it would have to be baker today audienc have higher expect baker s visual is realli an improv these visual work nice what doe not work is the wire assist leap some of the ape make they look like they were inspir by the physic defi leap of crouch tiger hidden dragon ape spring incred distanc some of the best scene are ape run into battl look like they have ape postur but when they start fli through the air the effect is lost one final visual problem is that the film frequent show it

stardom as the ape trader limbo he over emot to overcom hi ape make up but doe it veri well in do so he make himself the most interest thing on the screen he is probabl the best thing in the film and conjur up memori of peter ustinov s perform in spartacu as an in joke there are sever line in the script borrow from the film and an old ape play by charleton heston becom an allus to the first film

plung into the wood where they begin to argu about their differ approach to the experi on the veri first night that they decid to spend under the star amidst the ruin of parr s abandon hous strang thing start happen when they wake up their equip is gone and onli the tape remain after a while they discov strang mark on their bodi they are somehow lost in time as it loop uncontrol back and forth they are all haunt by hallucin and horribl nightmar and soon they can not see the differ between dream and realiti the onli thing that they are sure of is that they have brought someth or someon with them from the wood documentari director joe berling paradic lost helm blair witch leav the creator of the first film dan myrick and ed sanch in the background the open scene the documentari show the townspeopl affect by the first film is a more promis approach becaus instead of tri to cover similar ground it goe outsid the first film and make it own stand but soon the movi get confus and sidetrack by it own stori that is never resolv and end with a veri anticlimax epilogu in a way thi is a typic hollywood sequel more money ha been spent and more peopl have work on a project that wa doom to fail the horror and suspens of the origin simpli could not be repeat of cours in these situat quantiti is more import than qualiti and profit is more import than the artist valu from it open scene when the camera grace pane over the bloodi red forest with carter burwel s be john malkovich and fargo music score in the background you realiz that with the except of it titl thi film ha absolut noth to do with the blair witch project blair witch wa film by handheld videocamera and nfeatur act that wa mostli base on improvis in the sequel the technic aspect of the film is close to perfect creat a complet differ atmospher with it grace cinematographi product design and flashi edit the film ha a veri polish look which is imposs to associ with the first instal and though berling direct hi film with an energi and pace that make the adrenalin rush through the bodi a coupl of time he ha obvious misunderstood the natur of hi predecessor the key is simplic blair witch project had a stori which wa incred simpl that allow the audienc to fill the gap with our own imagin the film wa practic an empti screen on which we project our most frighten nightmar the effect wa incred power last and entir e everyon but in a differ way book of shadow feel incred control and restrict here veri littl is left to our imagin and the stori is so complex and clever that the screenwrit are the first to get lost in it there is is no book of shadow and no conclus that we can be satisfi with thi is simpli a less artist film that doesn t have the talent and origin of it predecessor it resort to fanci cinematographi and special effect to creat the right effect and doesn t alway succeed but most importantli it stand on it own ground and ha almost no connect with the first movi which doesn t allow it to destroy the origin in the end i can t call it a bad effort it s less artist not so scari and less origin but certainli not bad it s simpli differ in fact if you haven t seen the blair witch project you might like thi film for what it is a cross between the blair witch project and the scream film the onli element that remain constant and similar between the two film is the solid act jeffrey donovan and tristin skyler should be mention and incred sens of surreal but it s a common knowledg and experi that with a few except everi movi sequel is wors than the origin and some are even not worth make to me the stori of the blair witch project seem complet but there are obvious no limit to commerci success that the book of shadow is certainli assur and it s alreadi time to look forward to blair witch ,1,1

the pictur as it seem director simon west tri so hard to craft a film with atmospher and flash that he forgot a coher stori and good character are also crucial to a good movi what result is a film that look good but like that one scene just isn t right the first fifteen minut of the film is a good exampl paul brenner john travolta is an agent for the armi s crimin investig divis undercov at a georgia armi base to investig an illeg arm sale prior to the transact the buyer get a whiff that brenner isn t the unscrupul suppli sergeant he s suppos to be and later that night attempt to kill him

madelein stow to uncov the truth about the peculiarli gruesom murder what i want to know is whi the whole action scene with the arm buyer wa even necessari it give no insight into brenner other than the fact that he s a littl cocki doe the arm subplot turn up later no so whi add thi extra run time to the film the answer it look cool or how about the atmospher the begin of the gener s daughter present us with imageri of the deep south thick tree dirt road sultri color over water all back up with bayouesqu music nice immers in the set but it soon doesn t matter for when the film s plot shift

the abov exampl also serv to illustr that inconsist is anoth problem with thi movi as i ve alreadi mention an entir section of the film doesn t jibe with the rest and the character onli add to the

when their person are all over the place and in some case simpli unapp i could imagin that dure film west would shoot a scene then take the actor asid and tell them let s do it again but thi time i

of thi distant comet in about a few second he race off to mail the inform but is kill in a reckless car accid a year pass and noth is heard about it again we are then introduc to jenni lerner t a leoni a report for msnbc she get hand a job to investig a possibl cover up in the govern involv senat alan rittenhous jame cromwel she talk to a woman who mention that rittenhous wa have an affair with a girl name elli after talk with rittenhous and unsatisfi with the inform she get she decid to use the internet for help luckili she know exactli how to spell the certain elli that she is look for they spell it ele in the film that girl is pretti darn smart for guess how it wa spell befor she can use the inform the govern decid to push her car off the road they take her in to meet the presid of the unit state presid beck morgan freeman beck recommend that jenni keep the inform secret for hour so they can confirm it and then hold a press confer natur she want to be compens and they offer her a front row seat and the chanc for the first question and so yada yada yada they reveal the comet to the public and their plan send a massiv spacecraft out to destroy it befor it can arriv they announc a plan call ark which is their onli hope for surviv a comput will select peopl at random these peopl are the one who will go into a larg cave underground so that the impact of the comet won t kill off the entir human race after two year the dust will settl actual it would take much much longer approxim nineti year from what i understand and the human could come back to the surfac and start over the rest of the plot is your standard disast film procedur but there is one subplot worth mention jenni and her father jason maximilian schell have a veri touch relationship that form out of the impend doom the final moment involv the two charact is heartfelt and emot it s a shame that noth els is heartfelt now of cours we all know that the comet doe impact the surfac the titl alon suggest it and the preview actual show it by do thi absoltu no tension can be drawn from ani attempt to stop the comet becaus we all know that it won t work director mimi leder came from her success tri at direct with episod of the hit televis show er her major film debut wa the peacemak a pathet and heartless action film well thi time leder outdid herself creat a film wors than that one suggest to ms leder pleas stay away from the big screen or at least the action genr much of the blame can be place on leder directli becaus the pace is disastr off throughout the film we are given subtitl that tell us how much time ha pass it goe from month to week to hour it liter feel like thi laps time is take place in real time it s that bore of cours leder isn t all to blame for it screenwrit michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have craft a simplist stori that onli get wors with time what start out promis soon turn deadli for the audienc anyway chock full of cheesi one liner you know you are go to have more sex than anyon els in school and stupid charact you might think we were back in the s again onli one of the subplot is remot interest while the rest are forgett and bore and the main plot is so outrag that you can t figur out if thi film is suppos to be an action drama or sci fi to put it simpli the special effect of thi film are a hit and miss situat that s right miss and hit scene abov the earth are well done and the orbit ship is majest but the comet is a huge mistak make it more laughabl than frighten the concept of even tri to land on a comet is preposter enough but that s forgiv what isn t forgiv is actual have human walk on the surfac give me a break will ya and of cours the much hype collis of comet and earth well it is far from spectacular and it make independ day look brilliant the water rush toward the land is effect but onc it hit the contin the effect turn ridicul cgi water is use and it look so bad that i heard more laugh from the audienc than shriek in fact i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effect can actual get these day just when we think visual effect can t be improv along come a film to show that they realli can and should be one thing ha struck a wrong note with me concern mimi leder s direct which also influenc the actor leder love to show the actor face befor and dure moment of terror thi remind me of anoth action director renni harlin die hard cliffhang but harlin succe becaus he show the face of the victim in realist situat leder like to flaunt peopl s fear via their face but instead of come off as sympathet leder seem more of a sadist one moment ha an astronaut fli off into space thi should be enough to warrant a respons from the audienc but leder want to go farther and show us the person s face while drift into space thi is one of the cheapest way to ellicit an emot respons from an audienc and i for one am not go to be fool on anoth note leder s film onli pick up it pace dure the last fifteen minut when the comet actual impact the pace doe pick up and some veri emot moment are shown then again when you watch peopl cri for their love one it s obviou it will be emot it s mostli just a big trick to rope viewer into feel for the charact but it didn t work for me but anyway the actor do as much as they can with what they are given t a leoni bad boy tv s the nake truth is the best of the film and she is given the meatiest role her charact is made stronger by leoni s presenc and we grow to care for her robert duval is energet and fun to watch but hi charact is turn into shred by the plot elijah wood also come off rather success but he still hasn t had mani good role wood stick to drama you are too talent for thi stuff vanessa redgrav is bare acknowledg and her perform is onli enhanc by her strong presenc on screen maximilian schell is distract but he doe provid some nice humor morgan freeman ha been infinit better than thi and give one of hi most shallow perform to date which is quit remark for him leele sobieski could have been better but i think she just suffer from a poorli written charact a special note should go to ron eldard and denis crosbi eldard is good in hi role but is limit by the plot crosbi is special to me person becaus she wa tasha yar from tv s star trek the next gener see her wa one of the highlight of the film overal a veri talent cast virtual wast deep impact is rate pg for disast relat element and brief languag thi is one of the worst film of the year and if it is ani omen of thing to come thi summer could be one of the worst ever luckili the x file movi is come up and hope armageddon will be more success it s a shame that thi film will do so success becaus it just isn t worth much cost nearli million with special effect done by the illustri ilm which is a huge shocker and with a score compos by oscar winner jame horner titan one might have expect thi to be more fun to wit and experi well it s not when the comet doe hit the earth you almost wish it could just take thi film along with it ,0,0

171,it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequenc that includ a spaceship a green ovular pin and the birth of oscar wild but if one realli strain they can see that perhap mayb these connect are not half off wild s philosophi wa that everyon should be true to their own human natur and the result of hi follow thi philosophi wa that he wa imprison loos hi famili and hi career the glam rock movement in the earli s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demis the main differ wa by place makeup on their face and act out on their deepest fantasi and inquiri about life mostli deal with androgoni and sexual they becam less and less like themselv and more and more like everyon els and that s whi the movement seem to end as soon as it began it s been said that todd hayn velvet goldmin the film that chronicl what it wa like to be a part of the movement not onli from those who experienc it but by those who creat it steal a lot from citizen kane and that s true in the film a british journalist in the s arthur stuart christian bale is ask to go back and find out what happen to s glam rock star brian slade a fictiti rock star who fake hi own death on stage bring the end not onli to hi career but to the entir glam rock movement structur wise thi total steal from kane not onli from the set up he interview three peopl and the stori is a result of their flashback but in other thing like the begin death then newsreel and smaller detail like the bitter ex friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex wife as a wash up loung singer found in a bar after hour thi is no kane and it realli doesn t aspir to be it doesn t attempt to be the deep outlook of someth gone like kane did and it doesn t realli uncov anyth poignant about human instead it use the flashback as a form of contrast between the magic that wa the glam rock era and the boredom that wa life after glam rock for those who were particip the s scene are dri and deliri melancholi equip with a perform by bale that is perhap appropri dull and unengag but the s scene are engag though not to mention addict campi they radiat with gorgeou cinematographi that nice accentu all the vibrant color of the era and a feel that s so eerili lightheart that when combin with the then footag they becom not onli a symbol of decad but of time when everyth seem so simpl instead of creat the world the way it wa hayn paint their own world as if it were a narcot fairi tale the glam rock movement wa full of so much freedom and liber that after you ve experienc it everyth els seem so mundan there s no outsid world to speak of seclud these peopl insid a protect globe that will eventu crack hayn focus hi stori on the tale of blade and the other fictiti rock hero curt wild and their relationship that creat mold and then brought down the movement reduc everyon els who contribut to it as mere that contributor blade play with reserv by the pouti jonathan rhi meyer and wild play with anarch wild by ewan mcgregor are littl more than thinli disguis recreat of david bowi and iggi pop respect complet with the creation of a ziggi stardust persona name maxwel demon and the confirm that the two rock star may have veri well not onli have been one time partner in music but also partner in bed through discuss with slade s ex manag cecil michael feast ex wife mandi toni collett reinvent herself as an american blond dish who fake a british accent when with slade and final ex partner wild journalist stuart begin to rememb hi own experi in the era like hi discoveri of hi rebelli cum conform includ the moment when he began question hi own sexual when he open up hi first slade record he find a nake and green slade lie on a crimson blanket and final run away from home to be part of the london scene final result in lead a bore job in america hayn demonstr that he s quit the visual auteur mold scene that are like long heald breath such as a seemingli long sequenc juxtapos a slade wild concert of them perform a brian eno cover babi s on fire with scene from a decad drug parti and the film s most wow inspir sequenc the first concert scene of wild with hi band the ratttz where mcgregor let loos so much anarch steam that hi wild iggi esuq movement includ strip nake and scream that the film captur that perfect moment when one discov a major talent and anoth slade discov hi idl even the brief music video spoof of bowi s have a rare visual flair that s pure camp and which would caus ken russel to drool the best sequenc though may be the begin follow the prelud a sequenc which act as the middl ground for both the actual be of the movement and the post movement era in it stuart and hi mate are go to the infam slade concert where he fake hi own death where he kill off hi alter ego maxwel demon in what appear to be a real assasin which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet with brian eno s famou needl in the camel s eye play in the background the scene ha a detach exhiler the song doesn t seem to be play in quit the same way the other song are it ha a distanc that s hard to put a finger on and it seem to repres that all thi is come to a quick and sad end and when one see slade in the dress room befor the show dock in a silver frock with wing and blue hair depressingli stare into the mirror it come off as a none too obviou propheci of the final in the begin of the film thi movi s not so much about plot but more about the way it is present make thi one of those film which is classifi as be style over substanc a statement which prompt mani critic to line up for attack howev for the most part the engag part of thi film is not the stori but rather the way in which hayn creat thi world by use hi set costum cinematographi and especi the music to play as charact in hi film the music is especi notabl the soundtrack which is wall to wall consist of old school glam rock tune by the like of brian eno t rex and roxi music as well as cover by slade s band with vocal by thom york and occasion rhi meyer himself and even newer music by shudder to think that sound uncannili bowi like the cast is rather impress but no one realli walk away with the film and no perform are extrem good although eddi izzard as slade s manag who challeng slade s first manag to an arm wrestl match to see who get control of hi career and michael feast as the first and tragic manag come off greatli and collett and mcgregor have their moment rhi meyer and bale are notic sub par neither put a lot of effort into their respect role some of it is at fault with the actual construct of the film by hayn rhi meyer brian slade remain mere a metaphor for the glam rock era die when he turn into a retro garbo resort to a life of saling ism and found in the mid s to be lie around snif coke off the ass of a parti girl in fact no one in thi film is realli seen as a person rather than just as a symbol or composit of a type who thrive dure the era bale s charact is an especi tough sell bitter and depress by flashback to hi young adulthood he s not an extrem person charact and hi clich experi be hound by the record store guy for buy a record put out by a poof never help us commun with him nevertheless rhi meyer and mcgregor have the excus that their charact are not realli charact but rather the result of an era that ha left them and other bitter part of which help the film work sinc thi is a major piec of eye candi at the prime of the movi they at least look the role of fashion leader slade with hi perpetu chang androgoni persona and wild with hi topless and unpredict imag which clash and fuse into an unstabl union their stori of how slade wa so influenc by wild that he adapt it into a similar who care attitud cross with camp is engag without the person background the stori of stuart though is a tougher sell becaus he s the everyman and when you can t total identifi with the everyman your stori s in slight troubl as a cultur rock piec velvet goldmin is rather good but it is mere good it never total take off although it ha moment where it absolut fli but then come back down it s realli noth more than a bunch of realli great moment surround by materi that could realli be much better the begin is captiv but slow the middl is fantast and the end is not onli shallow but wors than that it drag the final half hour not onli doe it not bring the stori to ani real conclus it could probabl stop at ani point and did anyon realli figur out what the mysteri is that arthur unearth it almost seem like there wa no point in the entir investig other than to unearth the past which is commend but not total so still it doe what the oliv stone pic the door didn t do right becom veri insight to what happen use the visual style to hit most of the right note of contrast between what made the era so great to those who live dure it and whi after live through such an era that everyth els seem half ass i suppos the messag is live life but after you ve live it what els is the point when you ll be forc to live with regret memori the realli superb achiev of thi film is that dure it flashback it success creat for the audienc what it must have felt

195,oh god how mani john grisham lawyer film we have been munund with in a perfect world a civil action would be a breath of fresh air it s cynic about lawyer in a way that grisham isn t it s romant in the exact opposit way a grisham book film isn t and the capper it ha no distinct end and the law in hollywood film is that abov all els you must have an end even if it s base on a true stori a true stori which hasn t yet end you must suppli an end a fals one but an end nevertheless hell a civil action is even more sli and more witti than ani of the grisham work put togeth and that includ the firm the onli novel of hi that will ever be regard as a classic yet it s also oddli and slightli unsatisfi weird thi is in fact a steve zallian film not just the work of a hack and zallian is the director of the much admir search for bobbi fischer didn t see it and writer of none other than schindler s list in short i like thi guy and am a sucker for the way he tell hi stori after all apart from the obviou it s a holocaust film and it s a spielberg film isn t schindler s list just a damn brilliant film not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonder charact studi a civil action is the same way it s narr is split between be a lawyer film and be a charact studi and it s here that the film seem to go a bit wrong the main complaint of thi film is that while ye it s an engross lawyerli tale it ha no real end and that s not necessarili the problem with the film it s that it s just kind of unsatisfi if thi were a great film it would feel complet and still end basic the same way but thi film just seem to end and i don t want to be stupid and suggest an altern end should be tack on imagin if you will be one of those the film is about look forward to thi film and then discov the truth ha been through a surrealist and unpleas hollywood filter just so the mani won t bitch about what is essenti genuin but the fact that it just end is not in all actual what is wrong with it it s rather that zallian ha chosen in the last half hour to adandon the tradit lawyer stori and chose the other part of hi stori the one about the lawyer one jan schlictman john travolta who s shown in the open and throughout most of the movi as a heartless but brilliant lawyer brilliant becaus he s manipul and he alway win it wish to make it all about jan in the end but the truth is hi chang although nice done is not full we see him suffer from a person crisi and travolta doe do a pretti good job in depict hi chang of heart but in the end we don t fulli believ it and i think that the problem is when he ha made hi decis the film chose an odd angl to go at a nobl one but one that give the film s conclus that of incomplet in the open of the film we see him do hi old schtick manipul court win case effortlessli and then discuss on a heard radio interview how great he is at hi job and how much he care for hi case in short he s full of bullshit and we know it in the film he take a case that is hardli desir a town where sever of the children have die mysteri of lukemia and the sourc of the ill seem to be from a local factori that may or may not have been dump wast into the river point one it s not of the usual criteria jan point out wickedli that dead or wound children aren t nearli as sympathet as those struck down in the midst of their success point two it ha been through sever lawyer after turn them down jan chang hi mind a muddl scene he stop hi car on a bridg look out is he feel a sens of overachiev and he and hi team of lawyer toni shalhoub zeljko ivanek and account william h maci head out to the town to do battl with the town s compani they spend million of dollar examin the land test the water what have you thi is where stephen fri a possibl oscar nomine for hi brilliant perform in wild pop up thanklessli and in the meantim question the parent of the dead children and then unsuccess the worker at the plant they also find themselv clash with a brilliant lawyer for the compani the eccentr jerom facher play by robert duval more on him later on as we progress we get so involv in the way the stori is be told which is engulf everyth around it includ the individu and brief stori of some of the townspeopl one of the best is a bit with jame gandolfini as an employe of the plant live across the street from kathleen quinland who lost her child who begin to have a person crisi thing begin to go downhil for the lawyer in the second half as they are up against imposs odd the judg john lithgow is not onli a strickler but a pal of facher the employe of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testifi no concret evid is be found depsit the money spent to find it and they are quickli run out of money as maci mortgag everyth he can includ their home and their offic he slowli lose hi saniti hi meatiest role sinc oh fargo and we the audienc begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist in fact the last half hour is such a chang from the rest of the film and so unresolv that it ha been wide pan as not be up to par owen gleiberman especi critic the film for not be overli dramat i suppos like a grisham novel thi wouldn t be so if the chang in jan had not been handl the way it is instead of have a chang of heart and automat be perceiv as good he s seen as be still full of bullshit becaus he doesn t take stock in the care of hi partner and caus them all to lose their money and noteriati in the lawyer field becaus he want to help the peopl of the town he is instead seen as be of good natur but not sure how to bring that out the final half tri to redeem thi as must have been the point of make thi in zallian s mind but what follow is a seri of scene where we mere see him make person stand for hi belief and though he ha chang consider from the open moment when he s seen speed back and forth from the town that wish to employ him and thusli receiv two speed ticket we still feel that the big chang in hi life is that he s not rich and esteem anymor the film s final titl card is witti but in all actual shallow the fault is not that there is no closur to the court case it s still go on you know but that it person stori feel like it need either anoth chapter or anoth angl in the final one it ha we need to feel like the charact ha realli made a big chang in hi life and that the stori is how a stori of strife like the one of the town could inspir such a whop chang in hi person life it onli feel like half of that mayb even less and it s not travolta who doe a great job here though never to be a truli memor perform of hi but rather zallian whose final chapter need a rewrit up to then though it s an engross drama one of the best of the year in fact and one of the best lawyer film period the reason is becaus it recogn that a court trial is not about those be defend or prosecut but rather it s about the lawyer the knight who battl eachoth we learn that the compani is almost posit to blame for the death in the town but the reason it can t be blame is becaus it ha the best prosecut you can find and duval s facher is such a brilliant charact and he doe such a magnific job at portray that man that it s almost easi to overlook how subtley great he is facher is seen as an elderli man a goofi eccentr carri a broken brown bag with sticker on it eat lunch out of paper bag and make a point to take time out of hi day to listen to the radio and scold anyon who interupt him but look deeper and you see a master at work hi evil and manipul natur are hidden under the eccentr that other don upon him and it s difficult as hell to clearli gener him in ani way that s whi i like thi film it s hard to put a pointer on you can never see exactli where thi film will land and even when the credit roll you still aren t sure what to make of it call it the zallian effect same thing happen with schindler s list not that i m compar oskar schindler to jan schlictman each film is so greatli craft that you can t help but get involv in it broad storytel interest charact and most peculiarli the wit that come along with it if onli it felt total complet like say schindler s list though at thi point it may be unfair to make comparison between the two it might have been one of the best film of the year and along with that a full breath of fresh air ,1,1

person gain a terrorist employ random violenc as a mean to a polit end if the target nation doe not affect the desir chang in polici the violenc continu it is the fear result from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyon even total innoc anywher at anytim that give the figur hi label edward zwick s the sieg explor the possibl of thi kind of violenc take place right here in the unit state you d think the open bit wa rip right from the headlin arab terrorist kill american citizen abroad and the u s respond by retali against the sheik whom supposedli order the attack howev unlik the real

wa there ha never been a terrorist attack on american soil howev true it wa pull befor the movi s releas becaus it sound too much like a dare revisit the scenario of foreign terrorist commit act of violenc in the unit state the sieg is almost an invit in itself becaus it show just what kind of turmoil could be produc if an effect terrorist network were to set up oper here in america admittedli the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excess who s go to believ that a few bomb are go to caus new yorker to jump at the backfir of a bu or to curtail their shop by two third but the basic premis is still valid i like the fact that thi film rise abov the basic action thriller fare of good guy g men against bad guy terrorist by explor some of the effect on societi and law and order it provid a veri possibl hypothesi that violent activ on the part of a few arab would escal into a seri of hate crime against the arab american popul and that in an effort to find the terrorist the civil liberti of the minor may be violat by the govern itself in fact about halfway through the film when the presid author the declar of martial law within new york citi the liberti of all american are put at risk although it may actual be a side effect of a terrorist campaign the demis of social order in america is a scari thought and a goal which would not be beneath mani intern terrorist group throughout the film maintain a conflict between hubbard who want to use the fbi to pursu the terrorist within the letter of the law and gener devereaux bruce willi who is in command of the armi and of the mind that the greater good would be better serv by suspend the law and pursu the terrorist more forc what result is a fascin debat over the appropri and constitution of the declar of martial law and the invoc of the war power act util philosophi and histor exampl to make point on both side it actual get rather headi at time but it s a credit to screenwrit zwick lawrenc wright and menno meyj that they don t underestim the intellig of the audienc i don t know if it s hi tone or inflect or someth els but denzel washington ha a way of spit out dialog that make whatev he say sound great thi combin with hi innat act abil and hi experi in play the mid level author figur make hi perform in the sieg convinc and enjoy annett bene give one of the more assert portray of a femal charact i ve seen recent and the chemistri she share with washington is palpabl it s somewhat unfortun that her charact s fortitud is broken at a certain point but it allow us to watch bene play a littl more rang bruce willi is pretti much releg to a tough guy role alway stand straight and with a perman scowl fix upon hi face howev the tension that exist between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film s develop notabl is toni shalhoub who play fbi agent frank haddad a lebanes immigr the role call for evidenc both a kind of filial pride for hi heritag and contempt for those of hi own race who might interfer with hi integr into the american societi difficult to say the least shalhoub doe it with a natur you can almost reach out and touch perhap best known for hi role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom wing shalhoub gain notorieti for hi dramat abil in the wonder film big night wherea denzel washington seem to be edward zwick s favorit actor he direct washington in glori and courag under fire jame horner seem to be hi favorit compos i therefor found it odd that zwick chose the prolif score writer graem revel seven film thi year alreadi over horner for the sieg until i realiz that thi film contain a lot of arabian theme music and horner s record ha shown more of a propens for score either neutral in ethnic or irish sound at most revel doe a good job at provid appropri music to punctuat key scene and allow the score to enhanc the movi as a whole it s nowher near as intrus as in some of the other film we ve been get throughout the year misstep in the sieg can be found in a coupl of the excess it take for exampl it s pretti clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick unfortun there s a scene where the armi just cut loos against some arab immigr in a blatant display of firepow and explos obvious meant for the sole purpos of be eye catch in the middl of the citi and against no real opposit zwick even ha the armi use a cobra attack helicopt to shoot rocket into a build no farther than feet from friendli troop verisimilitud realli goe out the window at that point the film also get a littl preachi toward the end focus on the abil of differ race to get along a nobl gestur the film just put the messag across a bit too obvious these flaw are glare but they don t detract too much from an otherwis good film that make

have lost children ask them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger and for hi work stephen will receiv one third of the settlement money howev it is immedi appar that stephen ha littl or no interest in the money he is driven by someth els someth deeper that he share in common with the griev parent he ha lost a child too but not in the same manner hi daughter zoe caerthan bank

sad haunt voic that we often hear on the soundtrack read robert brown s poem about the pie piper and how when he led all the town s children away one wa left behind becaus he wa crippl obvious nicol

with her father tom mccamu there is onli one fleet scene that suggest thi relationship but it is somehow tie into the final act of the film of all the storylin in the sweet hereaft thi is the most complic and unresolv although it implic stretch throughout the entireti of the film egoyan know that the kind of question he bring up have no simpl answer if ani at all and he doesn t condescend to

draw the audienc into the tragedi the sweet hereaft seem to contain the combin emot impact that all hi other film lack the film is fill with beauti subtl perform from all the actor especi ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who wa left behind the beauti rove camerawork by paul sarossi and the haunt melod music score by mychael danna both previou egoyan collabor give the film a visual and aural cohes with the themat element like hi earlier film egoyan weav togeth multipl storylin that form a blanket whole he work with time as a fluid substanc shift back and forth between the past the distant past and the present with effortless eas the actual bu wreck itself doesn t happen until midway through the film but by that time the event ha built up so much emot that egoyan can film it from a distanc with no graphic detail and still have it carri great devast weight becaus human life ha becom such a cheap commod in movi it is astound that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simpl direct term certainli one of the best film of the sweet hereaft is a deepli reward mystifi and ultim human film ,1,1

cusack s mug in the paper hope for an oh him ye he s quit good instead i got a no i don t know him at thi point i wa way beyond frustrat into a realm of nose hair yank anger ye filmic ignor is all it take to get me into the nose hair pull zone till i realiz someth i doubt that much of america would recogn cusack s rel bland visag or even the name which is rather bland compar to the cool of a brad pitt or tom cruis one syllabl name that glide off the tongu with the veloc of a speed car cu sack cu sack no not quit as cool i m sure that twenti year from now cusack will forev be refer to as the guy from add in the cusack film of your choic he s not a brand name and hi movi usual aren t big moneymak but in hi own unassum way he s kind of a geniu with hi pleasant common man look and charm semi articul blather he ha becom one of the most likeabl romant lead men of the s from the sure thing to say anyth cusack ha merg the talent of earli tom hank and earli jack lemmon despit the fact that nearli everi charact he play is a variat of the charact befor it the schlumpi everi man he s a constantli enjoy screen persona like albert brook or woodi allen and he know how to chose script while the stephan baldwin s and val kilmer s seem to put them selv in everyth the former actual had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspect with a pauli shore vehicl and judg from hi latest project it look like he still ha yet to fire hi agent cusack gener pick reward project save for the unwatch hot pursuit a film also featur a young ben stiller high fidel is hi second collabor with hit or miss english director stephan fear the grifter the hi lo countri and it s a hit it wa also co written by cusack and some of hi collabor on the terrif comedi gross point blank it s not quit as entertain or as funni as that film but as it progress in it meander fashion the movi cast someth of a spell over me high fidel begin as a hipster ode to the non committ rob a vinyl record store owner who open the film by break down the fourth wall with much abandon and educ us in hi top break up list thi is someth cusack doe the entir film a la ferri bueller s day off at first the talk directli into the camera schtick had me vagu annoy mostli becaus it remind me so much of the film bodi shot which use a similar conceit but it began to grow on me due almost entir to cusack s witti deliveri he s the kind of guy we don t mind talk directli to us gradual the film settl into a shampoo like tragi comic charact studi of a guy who must confront himself and hi person failur in order to figur out the true person he is ye it s all veri existenti though that plot line is mostli enjoy the thing i like the most about the film is how much pleasur it offer in introduc us to minor charact all of whom now thi is realli someth are terrif enough to warrant their own film the best of which is jack black of the veri funni show tenaci d a program that sadli went the way of bruce willi hair unfortun that annoy smirk remain an ardent record store employe who bulli custom into buy exactli what he want them to buy he s the kind of guy i m sure we ve all met befor a blowhard who think he s alway right and will do anyth in hi power be it yell argu insult to hoist hi opinion onto other but i like thi guy becaus of how black play him the actor is portli with a round babi face and crazi eye but despit hi size he leap to and fro like a manic speed freak which might be a bit of a redund descript see as how all the speed freak i know are manic he s the kind of support charact who would be imposs annoy comic relief in most other film look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister but fear and black never let that happen the charact for all hi shuck and jive is steep in realiti he s over the top but in a way we can all probabl relat to catherin zeta jone in her brief role give a vivid portray of a women complet enamor with her own charm tim robbin regist in an even tinier part as a new age type a charact play entir for cartoon yuk but still manag to work it desir comic effect the one except in the act depart is a bit of a doozi the main love interest play by danish actress iben hjejl mifun who complet obliter ani trace of a danish accent replac it with a stilt american phonat i give her kudo for attempt such a contradictori role but instead of be likeabl she come across as rather robot and as such it s hard to see whi cusack s charact would be so obsess with her especi when he ha a beauti intellig writer natasha gregson wagner potenti wait in the wing thi remind me of say anyth where the charm cusack wa pair with the charmless ion skye and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood whose unbeliev more wooden then father clint for those special peopl whose wheel turn a littl slower in fact cusack is rare pair up with a person that match hi though i d bet that if laura and natasha switch role the result would be more effect high fidel work almost entir on the strength of it charact and perform fear direct is somewhat stilt and the script is sometim a littl too and thi is a word i m begin to hate to use but ala i must quirki for it own good i think i ll blame that on scott rosenberg who judg from what he did with beauti girl con air and thing to do in denver while your dead ha hi fingerprint all over the most irrit bit of thi movi but cusack realli doe deserv an award for be so damn cusackian i m afraid that hi talent are so underst that he may have to wait till hi hip need replac to be offer such an award worthi of hi consider talent hi charact rob whose sort of like an older more bitter lloyd from say anyth is funni and tragic without be pathet and that cusack can

he make hi own tribe use hi three children as actor in a video he simpli make up certain incred fact about thi tribe which he call the shelmickedmu audienc at krippendorf s lectur are amaz by hi find that the shelmickedmu practic circumcis and proof that the typic famili unit is led by a singl father is truli amaz to the anthropolog commun like all film like thi the lie becom more and more complex and the suspens is gener with us wonder at what point it is all go to fall out from under our hero dreyfuss is a funni talent man and he is funni in thi film he ha lot of posit energi and unlik most comic actor realli manag to play peopl like thi realist thi film also requir a lot of physic humor that i ve never seen dreyfuss perform and he doe a great job jenna elfman who play veronica mecilli a scientist who want in on krippendorf s work is also veri funni and appeal here and the kid actor are great as well but we re talk about the script from hell thi is one of those stori that requir such extrem suspens of disbelief that they might as well have establish that the stori just take place in an altern univers where thing like thi can happen but the ridicul of the stori is not realli what is so bad about it all the clich and the irrit plot devic could have easili been overcom by dreyfuss and crew no the script is plagu with so mani clueless stereotyp and mean spirit charact that i wa in disbelief as i watch furthermor the manor in which all of thi materi is cover up is truli shameless take for instanc the scene in which krippendorf get veronica drunk so he can tape them have sex they get all deck out in the tribe getup complet with paint to darken their skin krippendorf doe thi becaus he need footag of the mate ritual of hi tribe now i saw thi scene come from a mile away but i said to myself no that would be far too tasteless there s no way they ll do that oh god they did do it it s there i wa almost more appal by the fact that thi didn t bother the other audienc member with whom i saw thi film i found it deplor and when krippendorf is forc to admit that he did it he simpli apolog without the slightest hint of convict in hi voic the film is fill with scene like these they not onli insult the audienc but they insult the type of peopl that the film portray it would take some truli profession work to creat video convinc enough to fool an entir commun of scientist yet krippendorf doe it easili in an afternoon and watch dreyfuss stumbl over a complet unprepar speech is funni and entertain but i think that most member of the on screen audienc would be abl to see that he is make everyth up as he goe if i were an anthropologist thi film would insult me immens move right along the film play off everi stereotyp our cultur ha ever learn regard african tribe sure dreyfuss dress up like a chief is realli funni and it allow for some entertain scene but the heart of thi materi is deepli clueless as to the theme and thought that it provok it is becaus of dreyfuss as an actor that i wa abl to watch thi film hi charact here is not a good subject for a film becaus he is a shameless liar and never onc doe he show ani kind of penanc for what he doe i suppos it wa interest to see the formula defi in thi case but for the purpos of good tast i would have expect someth no thi man set a terribl exampl for hi kid and colleagu and the writer of the film charli peter didn t includ a singl scene in which krippendorf take hi kid asid and tell them that what he is do is veri bad in fact it s hi eldest daughter that frequent tell him that he is do the wrong thing and he continu shrug off her warn i suppos it s import to admit that thi is a funni film dreyfuss and elfman and mani of the contriv and insult scene add up to a pictur that is anyth but bore and if you re less seriou than i you probabl will enjoy it i howev can t get past these element krippendorf s tribe is be market as a famili comedi but thi is the kind of film that teach the kid of our societi faulti lesson that they shouldn t be learn with a littl more insight into it stori and theme thi could have been a good movi ,0,0

where enemi jame caan and benicio del torro stop in their track to have a cup of coffe and pontif on life philosophi etc i didn t like the bit much when it first appear in heat here it s even more

becaus peopl no longer have expect one idiot super hype blockbust flick after anoth ha desensit audienc to the point where film don t need to do anyth more than promis a good time without the ad pressur of deliv if anyon disagre i would love for them to explain the box offic success of shit like batman and robin wild wild west and godzilla but forget all that it goe without say that mad slasher film or ani other exploit off shoot will be made without an ounc of craft especi consid the sheer volum that are produc allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film the lack of enthusiast exploit these flick aren t har with ani lofti aspir so whi not break free and give your audienc a bloodi good time sadli out of the liter hundr made i would estim that mayb three are at all worth while and urban legend would certainli not be includ amongst those three despit it consider product valu and the absenc of ani boom mic slip into frame it is just as aw as ani no budget entri in the slasher sweepstak as far as the possibl of some good natur exploit urban legend s set alon offer a myriad of promis possibl it take place on a colleg campu which is alway an appropri playground for the craze killer you see the campu is a commun made up almost entir of young peopl all in the midst of strang hormon surg percol beneath the surfac all those young peopl are grow up togeth go through all kind of inexplic emot high and low so natur some weird is expect all the better for that elus craze killer coupl with the copiou amount of scantili clad co run around and the introduct of a littl exploit into the proceed should be a rel easi task but ala urban legend is not onli idiot and clich full it s way too clean a slasher flick for the whole famili with no nuditi littl gore and much stupid thi is the kind of movi where the killer drag dead victim from the scene of the crime for no reason other than i dunno exercis it s the kind of movi where the villain calmli purs a run like the wind prey yet still manag to catch that prey through some realli aw edit techniqu it s the kind of movi where charact run into each other just as a loud clash reverber on the soundtrack i realli wish filmmak would just retir that whole loud nois jump scare thing ye the audienc jump momentarili frighten but wouldn t anyon if a loud sonic boom suddenli infiltr a quiet room i lost all hope for the possibl of ani genuin scare in urban legend about ten minut in when i caught a glimps of the killer appar filmmak are run out of creativ way to disguis their mad slasher in scream it wa a ghost mask scari enough in i know what you did last summer it wa a fisher man s rain slicker in the middl of summer no less and in urban legend the disguis sink to the level of mel brook parodi the villain wear an overs parka with a furi hood ooh scari intend to conceal hi her ident for urban legend i humbl suggest a donald duck costum though i must admit urban legend doe have a win premis for what could have been a somewhat entertain exploit film the film s killer slice and dice come colleg student to the tune of famou urban legend you know like the babysitt get threaten phone call onli to find that they re come from insid the hous i won t spoil the surpris as to what urban legend are use after all the film doe offer fine am cabl view if you happen to be intox enough

elabor hoax at hi expens at everi turn he is stop by an amaz coincid that just happen to keep him in hi own littl town hi last hope is to quell hi fear of the ocean and sail to the edg of the world you know by now that truman s life is the subject of a televis program hi action are real but everyth els is care script from the death of hi father to the choic of hi wife truman is determin to find out what the big hoax is meanwhil christof the all see creator of truman s world doe hi best to keep him unawar and happi it s sort of like westworld told from the robot point of view or jurass park from the dinosaur point of view we root for the captiv of the cage world our protagonist is count on chao theori to help him escap hi elabor trap the stori written by andrew niccol writer director of gattaca introduc some interest question such as the ethic of subject a person to thi type of life or the psycholog impact of learn that your entir life ha all been fake although these question came to mind i don t think the film itself ask them it certainli didn t address them or tri to answer them i wa particularli disappoint that the film didn t deal more with the trauma of learn one s life is a tv show carrey s perform at the end show a smidgen of truman s pain but i almost felt that he got over it too easili for the sake of the film s pace earlier in the movi i found myself wonder if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well the two seem exclus of one anoth but weir and niccol didn t see it that way perhap it s not fair to critic a movi for what it isn t but it seem like there were some miss opportun here but on it own term the movi is well made sight sound and pace are all handl compet much of the first part of the movi is the truman show the scene are all appar shot from hidden camera with snoot and obstruct cover the corner of the screen one hidden camera is appar in hi car radio the green led number obscur the lower part of the screen the music is well chosen and score the film open with what sound like famili drama theme music when truman s world is still beauti and perfect when the movi end the score sound more like a frantic driven tangerin dream opu while still keep the same timbr philip glass epic music from powaqqatsi permeat truman s scene of suspicion and awaken glass ha a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show and the pace of the stori wa brisk there wa no unnecessarili long setup explain the concept behind the truman show just a few quick titl card a few interview and then right into the show and the movi one of the first scene is of the studio light fall there wa no token scene of truman s idyl life befor it fall apart becaus it wasn t necessari we pick up the stori at the first sign of troubl and no sooner there s also no point in the movi where the plot slow down it s a quick straight shot to the movi s end in term of overal qualiti i would compar the truman show to niccol s gattaca both film are well made with interest stori set in interest world but neither film realli felt like it capit on all the great idea neither film click and becam an instant classic nevertheless i look forward to niccol s next film whatev it may be ,1,1

351,true faith and it express through organ religion is a difficult subject for a motion pictur to tackl head on which is probabl whi so few of them do it even the most religi director like martin scorses or ingmar bergman usual address issu of faith in implicit rather than explicit religi term so it s not hard to see whi it took robert duval fifteen year to get the apostl onto the big screen as a matter of fact even after fifteen year he still never manag to get financi back and he end up pay for it with million of hi own money he also wrote the script direct the film and star as the central charact a fieri texa preacher name euliss sonni dewey few filmmak have the courag and sheer audac to take on that kind of financi technic and creativ respons singl handedli and it s testament to what an intens person project thi wa for duval and thank everi bit of that person invest translat on screen into power and honest emot sonni is an energet pentecost preacher who ha been speak actual shout from behind the pulpit sinc he wa twelv he spend much of hi time travel about the countri evangel with other preacher at tent reviv unlik most hollywood character of intens preacher sonni is not a phoni or a swindler and the film s purpos is not to unearth hypocrisi and sin in either sonni or the church duval make it abundantli clear that sonni truli believ in what he say although like all human he ha weak one of hi weak becom appar when he find out that not onli doe hi long suffer wife jessi farrah fawcett want to leav him for anoth man in the congreg but the two of them have secretli plot to remov him as preacher face with the loss of two thing he love passion hi church and hi famili that same raw power that allow sonni to get entir congreg rock and sway transform into a violent temper at hi son s basebal game sonni snap and smash hi wife s lover in the face with a basebal bat inflict a wound that may be fatal not know what els to do sonni disappear he throw away hi identif drive hi car into a lake and take a bu to louisiana hope to start over again in the tini mostli poor coastal town of bayou boutt sonni onc again find hi call after befriend a simpl auto mechan walt goggin and track down the town s ex minist john beasley sonni set up hi own church the one way to heaven templ re christen himself as the apostl e f he quickli draw togeth an eager congreg and togeth they realiz real chang in each other s live but alway sonni s past is lurk a step behind him wait to swallow hi progress duval ha made hi intent in make the apostl clear in a recent articl in newsweek he wrote filmmak hardli ever depict spiritu with such a strong emphasi on the holi spirit and when they do it tend to be patron full of charlatan and snake handler but what i realli want to do wa tri to understand what these preacher go through and what they believ and to portray it in an accur way the strength of duval s convict turn out to be the strength of hi film the apostl alway ring true even in the most pain moment becaus we know he s be sincer with the subject matter after fifteen year of travel the countri listen to all shape and size of minist and take studiou note on what they said duval ha captur the energi and vital of what it mean to be truli spiritu hi sonni is a man who speak directli to god and expect to be spoken right back to i ve alway call you jesu and you ve alway call me sonni he say when neighbor call and complain that he is be too loud one night in one hi rant with the man upstair sonni s mother june carter cash just hang up on them becaus she know there s no sens tri to interrupt him the main theme to emerg from the apostl is the fact that good can come from ani situat sonni s act of violenc toward anoth human be is inargu a horrif thing and duval never shrink from that fact howev that veri same act of violenc is what bring sonni to bayou boutt where he find peopl whom he desper need and who desper need him in hi short time in louisiana he doe a world of good and when the polic final show up to take him away he goe quietli know that he deserv the punish that is await him and as a scene dure the final credit show he even turn hi punish into a posit opportun for chang and better it is that strength in sonni s charact that make him so appeal and magnet to other he is flaw but he is power enough to overcom those flaw weak men are the one who simpli accept their weak and lack the desir to better themselv watch duval on screen it s not hard to imagin that he would have been a magnific preacher if he had chosen that vocat over act as sonni he complet inhabit the charact and hi perform is certainli the best of the year becaus he spent so much time absorb the trait method quirk and person of real preacher duval wa abl to creat a complet charact who alway feel indel human as a director duval feel that less is more hi camera simpli take in what goe on in front of it with veri littl intrus there are no fanci crane shot or extend dolli or excess close up duval knew that the power of the film s charact enhanc by the fact that he cast mostli non profession churchgoer and actual minist didn t need to be artifici

374,alien is the onli alien film i have seen in theater i saw it when i wa year old and i must admit that i didn t like it of cours i wa expect alien again and i believ thi wa my fault in order to appreci alien you need to see alien but you also have to wipe away all the expect from it predecessor jame cameron s alien wa an action film and mani peopl consid it the best in the seri i am among that group but alien is an extrem entertain film which critic have bash for it origin mani thought the final chase scene went on for too long and mani other thought that the film wa too much dialogu and not enough action both are untru becaus the film ha quit a bit of action and the dialogu wa essenti and well written as for the chase sequenc it wa long but not overli long creat quit a bit of suspens from confus perhap watch alien on video help on the big screen i wa overwhelm by someth i normal didn t see it wa a veri dark film and the languag wa extrem harsh i had alway figur the alien seri to reli on smart dialogu instead of moron profan don t get me wrong i m not say film should elimin swear but when a film substitut dialogu with these profan remark it get rather distract howev sinc see it again i realiz that the swear is mainli just an aspect of the restrain hatr in the charact as a result alien s onli flaw albeit a major one is the underdevelop charact we never realli care about ani of them and i get the feel that mani scene were cut in order to shorten the length of the movi there were onli two charact i like and of cours one wa lt ripley sigourney weaver although we have gotten to know her through two other film the other charact wa dr clemen charl danc but becaus we like him the inevit occur alien begin exactli where alien left off the prologu of alien is a pure cinemat achiev by director david fincher who had onli direct music video befor hi chanc with thi alien entri without use a singl line of dialogu unless you count comput warn fincher set up the entir film an impress aspect of thi is that fincher onli show a few second of film befor cut to a titl card we see lt ripley and the littl girl in their cryogen compart titl a shot of an alien egg titl alien leg stretch up into the air titl and so on and so on dure these first ten minut i learn everyth i had to in order for alien to proceed it s quit a remark open and one which will remain in my mind for a long time becaus of thi face hugger which ha been hatch aboard the vessel from alien the hypersleep contain are sent into an escap pod and sent down to the nearest planet fiorina furi an ore refineri which ha been turn into a maximum secur prison howev the face hugger manag to attach itself to one of the cryo tube and is sent down with the escap pod unfortun dure the land all but one of the survivor from alien is kill ripley is discov by some of the inmat and taken back to the refineri of cours you need a carrier for thi face hugger and it attach itself to the dog which came with the team of inmat ripley is reviv and ask to see the ship after see a mysteri acid eaten section ripley ask to see the dead bodi and then have them cremat thi cremat scene is one of the most power and impress of all the alien film featur a monologu from dillon charl s dutton a prison who ha found god the movi cut back and forth from the ceremoni to the dog s demis it s one of the most memor moment as the speech reflect exactli what is go on with the dog and thi is where alien succe fincher normal inject a lot of symbol into hi film and i can easili see him becom the next stanley kubrick or alfr hitchcock in fact he is the mixtur of both fincher know exactli what to film and how to film it and i figur that he will be one of the few director with complet control over hi film alien is riddl with symbol speech and metaphor imag by do so fincher creat some of the best scene in the entir alien franchis mani peopl have critic fincher s film of the death scene of ripley i reveal noth by say thi as look too fake but i enjoy and relish in the portray show ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch but by actual not show her hit the vat of iron a great deal of symbol is deriv i feel that it would have spoil the mood of the entir film if they had actual shown her splash into the molten iron howev most peopl seem to want to wit ripley die which creat a paradox as she is the charact i didn t want to see die whi she is kill is one of the surpris of the film and i don t plan on spoil that in thi review from everi alien film come sever memor moment which seem to stick with you forev in alien it wa of cours the moment the alien burst out of kane s stomach in alien it wa the showdown between alien and ripley in a machin alien ha sever but most memor is the terrif shot involv the alien and ripley ripley is push up against a wall and the alien stand inch away from her whi it doesn t kill her is a shocker which later lead to a surpris end fincher appar love to use close up of actor face michael dougla and the clown face off in the game in the same style and by shave off the actor hair the onli thing we have to look at is their face mani critic didn t like all the actor be bald but it make complet sens when taken in context of the plot most of alien work when you take it in context of the stori but when you tri to compar it to it predecessor fincher s turn seem a bit gloomi and dark though that s not alway a bad thing the plot is pretti much a rehash of the first two film with some major twist again we are setup with sever differ charact and one by one they are pick off howev while the first two had ton of arsen especi cameron s film alien take place on a planet devoid of human life except for thi run down prison as a result no weapon are to be found thi creat a lot of tension although i must admit that fincher could have ad a lot more suspens as an alien film alien is the worst of the seri but by itself it is an extrem well made motion pictur with a lot more merit than not the unfortun thing surround thi second sequel is the one dimension charact i never wa realli emot involv on screen becaus most of the charact are hardcor crimin whom i realli could care less about despit thi ripley wa the central figur and that s what is import we care for her even though she began to act just like one of the guy again the technic side of thi film is remark and better than the two previou version while cameron s version wa a pump up action film with massiv artillari fincher use brilliant camera angl terrif light and moodi set the cinematographi by alex thomson is veri well done with a terrif chase sequenc toward the end of the movi the confus of the end draw the viewer in as we are just as confus as the actor who are be chase around the yellow red and orang of the light creat a dark mood and by themselv creat a lot of suspens shadow danc on the wall and yet those shadow could easili be the alien the alien is differ from it predecessor thi time around and the swift of thi alien is quit intens the camera like to take up the perspect of the alien race after the charact the set are quit incred which are reminisci of the nostromo from alien the narrow corridor and labrynthin hallway is well construct the set appear to be in the futur but not too far in the futur one of the set piec even aid in the destruct of the alien noth surpris there sigourney weaver turn out yet anoth good perform equal her portray of ripley in alien she wa snub at the oscar for thi one mainli becaus the film wa a critic bomb her reaction are far more realist in thi film with her cri over the loss of the littl child she risk her life save in her previou encount it s quit touch realli charl s dutton is veri strong in hi perform as one of the inmat and i wa on the brink of actual care for him charl danc turn in a nice low key perform and as a result i care for him immedi lanc henriksen make a brief appear as bishop ii but he wa more entertain in alien the rest of the cast is pretti stale though pete postlethwait stick out due to hi recent turn in the usual suspect and the lost world alien is rate r for strong violenc and languag and sex although it ha it flaw alien is highli entertain with rich symbol thi film remind you how much fun it is to spot metaphor imag throughout a movi while kubrick may have a moral messag throughout hi film fincher reli on cinemat devic to bring hi mean out it s a film like fincher s which remind us that it is okay for a film to sacrific qualiti for quantiti the final scene in fact it tell us that we as a societi have becom too critic of thing which may happen to look a littl fake whenev someth look fake on screen we immedi point it out as a mistak but perhap it isn t a mistak ,1,1

excalibur and the father son jungl adventur the emerald forest hi film all show that boorman is never lack in imagin but sometim that come at the cost of coher and tast if boorman is anyth he s ambiti and when he succe it s in grand fashion unfortun the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman fall the resound impact can be heard for mile around zardoz is meant to take it place among the grandest of mystic movi an obsess of boorman s hi screenplay tri to elicit the same mytholog connot of the arthurian legend or even the wizard of oz a book which figur into the movi s plot but despit all thi reach the result movi is more unintent funni than intent enigmat or compel the event take place in the distant year but there is littl of the typic futurist movi ness to be found in fact thing seem to have move backward with peopl ride hors shoot old style gun and live in larg victorian mansion it s more middl age than space age the world of zardoz is divid into two distinct hemispher the outland where all the poor pathet peopl live and the vortex where a select group of wealthi intellectu live in comfort and everlast life these immort never grow old they never engag in sexual activ they possess psycholog power and they live in a sort of quasi utopian marxist societi where everyon is equal and everyon contribut equal to the societi howev if one break the rule that person is punish by be age so mani year if someon break the rule enough he or she is age to the point of senil and imprison to an etern exist in a geriatr home with other age crimin one of the immort arthur frayn niall buggi a squirmi man with a mustach and goate tattoo on hi face is charg with keep order in the outland and forc the resid to farm so the immort can be fed like the wizard of oz he adopt a god like statu among the peopl by fli in to their part of the world in a giant stone carv like a menac head thi fli head is one of the movi s open imag and it s a dead giveaway of the lunaci to come call himself zardoz frayn gather a bunch of outland and make them into a group call the extermin whose purpos is to kill most of the other outland so they can t procreat and take up more resourc from insid hi giant stone head zardoz bellow serious laugh induct statement like the gun is good the peni is evil that line alon is worth the movi s cult follow one day an extermin name zed sean conneri sneak into zardoz s fli stone push frayn out and goe back to the vortex onc there the immort label him a brutal and studi him like a lab rat take great pervers care in explor hi sexual which is a mysteri to them they seem especi interest in hi abil to gain an erect and there is one downright hilari sequenc where a bunch of scantili clad femal scientist show zed erot footag on a video screen in an attempt to determin what get him work up i say hilari becaus that is exactli what zardoz is it is obviou that boorman did not intend it to be so he made thi film with the straightest of face although i have a hard time believ that as product move forward he didn t get even the slightest inkl of how patent ridicul it wa becom just look at conneri is enough to give one the giggl he spend most of the film run around in a red loin cloth that resembl a diaper a mane of hair braid halfway down hi back a wyatt earp style handlebar mustach and a pair of thigh high patent leather boot that would look more appropri on a cheap hollywood hooker boorman made the film right after the critic and financi success of deliver which is the onli reason i can imagin a studio would green light thi effort he attract some rich talent on both side of the camera includ cinematograph geoffrey unsworth whose strike visual are about the onli good thing in zardoz besid the inadvert humor sean conneri had made hi last jame bond film in and perhap he wa look for a chang in pace he got exactli that in zardoz and it s a wonder it didn t end hi career i m sure boorman intend for thi movi to make some grand statement is it a treatis about the infal of etern life is it a condemn of those who consid grow old to be a bad thing or is it a social statement someth about the inher neg of class distinct and the violenc it creat karl marx might like it if he were more like timothi leari come to think of it mayb boorman made it as an extend lsd trip peopl high on illicit substanc are the onli one i can imagin enjoy thi asinin silli as anyth more than a complet unintent comedi ,0,0

take ball but intellig to make a human be out of a neo nazi skinhead a kind of person who dedic their live to hate anyon who s not what they are and thi film wise and miracur pull it off the subject of thi film is one of them but he is wors than one of the blind follow that make up most skinhead member sinc he is the leader of the pack he s the one who instig them to take a firm grip onto their rage and then in anoth brilliant stroke justifi it with polit propoganda that make eeri sens when he speak he s so utterli convinc as a public speaker and so firm in hi convict that it come as a shock when he actual goe through the rehabilit process hi name is derek vinyard and he s play by edward norton with so much fire and intens that when he speak he s almost as convinc and arrest a public speaker as say malcom x when we first see him he s clean shaven with a jet black swastica emrboid on hi left breast a devlish goate and he s attack the black carjack outsid of hi hous dress in noth but hi white boxer and carri a handgun in hi hand that never seem to run out of bullet at least when he doesn t need them he so believ in hi convict that he s will to put hi belief to the test even if he know it will mean a stop in prison if onli for a coupl year american histori x is about derek how he becam a neo nazi skinhead how he rose to power how he wa rehabilit in prison after murder two black men in a fit of rage that wa less to do with the steal of hi car and more to do with prove himself and how he tri to save other name hi younger brother from make the same mistak we see him at all of these stage as a smart teenag a viciou hate monger a man have an epiphani and the man who tri to correct what he s done befor and in all of these we get a portrait of a man from all side or at least that s the intent the film s frame devic is hi brother danni edward furlong perpetu look about also now a skinhead and how hi princip bob sweeney averi brook who i just found out wa or is the captain on star trek s deep space is tri to correct him when the film open danni ha just written a book report on mein kampf land him in troubl with sweeney which caus him to make him write a paper on derek s life and how it ha gotten him nowher coincident thi day is the day derek is releas from prison and when we see him he s clean up not as buff and ha a full head of hair he s just as intellig but still veri rough along the edg but he s wisen up he s no longer control by hi anger at black and jew and tri to persuad danni who s becom what derek wa befor to give up hi lifestyl but danni won t he goe to a larg skinhead beer bash meet with the skinhead leader staci keach and then discov that derek is as oppos to neo nazi dom as he wa for it a coupl of year ago the film circl around thi then spin off into non linear flashback all done in black and white we mostli see derek at hi prime as a skinhead live in venic beach organ viciou and quasi sadist raid on local store that no longer hire the white middl class teenag sinc they can easili get cheaper illeg immigr to do the same work and mouth off hi theori on affirm action and how illeg immigr and black have destroy the fundament thi countri wa built on to them the white man is the one who ha gotten the fuzzi end of the lolipop and he not onli speak elloqu forc and intellig but he back everyth up with polit reason justifi their rage at least to them and frighteningli enough much of what he say sound true american histori x is a collect of realli great scene and moment rather than a cohes great film that flow effortlessli from one moment to the next in it there are some of the best scene i ve seen all year one scene featur a dinner between derek s famili and hi mother s newest boyfriend play with reserv by eliott gould a jewish liber who quietli disagre with derek s rightist view launch the scene into a fit of rage and anger that build unparal emot in the audienc gould s reaction to derek s final summat is unnerrv anoth scene use humor and tradit macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connect between derek and a black co worker guy torri while fold laundri in prison and anoth soon to be classic is actual divid in two the murder of the two black men that wind derek in jail which contain a final murder so nasti that it may be the most revoltingli shock all year there s much more to appreci like the act which is uniformli good with stand out come from averi brook beverli d angelo as the long suffer mother and gould who ha one horribl line but other than that come off with the best perform he s given in what seem like a realli long time norton walk off with the film though come off with such intens that he reduc anyon not do an adequ job to rubbl in onli the fifth movi of hi career norton ha invent himself as one of the most reliabl and intens actor of hi gener and mayb the best there s noth like it when norton realli get roll in thi movi spew out line with such author that he command all attent from the audienc come off with power similar to that of a young maron brando that he allow the littl emot to seep through is amaz sadli enough thi isn t go to be the great portrait of racism that it perhap hope to be it s too unambiti and even a littl contriv to realli take off as either a power statement or an emot masterpiec the end especi is pencil in from other movi toss in just so the emot keyboard can be trounc upon some of the skinhead are reduc to mere clich kevin smith regular ethan suple fair rather annoyingli as the fat skinhead whose line consist without fail of express hi desir to eat more and even the dramat arc isn t as well travel furlong s danni never seem to realli be learn a lesson sinc the flashback refus to show hi point of view and when he decid to make a chang by the end which wa inevit it doesn t seem like it ha actual arriv there even derek s descent into skinhead dom doesn t seem justifi though hi fireman father william russ the dad from boy meet world and don t ask me how i know that is kill by a black junki and even befor he spoke against affirm action intellig there never seem to be ani real back stori whi derek becam so intens about hi belief as such one can see whi the director toni kay want to have hi name remov sorta american histori x is a veri good movi and i wa veri move by it but it could be a lot better and the problem seem to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claim to be hi potenti somewher he claim there lie a toni kay cut and that wa to be the true cut until it wa view by norton who then order anoth cut and that is thu although he aim for the direct credit to go to alan smithe the resid name for ani film that is to be disown by it director it wasn t allow to him under the ground that onc you disown a film you can not badmouth it but realli that s the macguffin no one realli want a film thi good to be given the alan smithe sign of disapprov kay s right in that it s not up to par even if he s not refer to normal par but rather hi own person par thi will not be a do the right thing for the late s yet it still get it point across intellig and back it up with it stori it messag that one can not be so enwrap in one s own belief or pain and suffer will occur is liter said over the narrat unfortun and even if it isn t perfect at least when averi brook turn to norton after he ha been beaten and rape in prison and ask him if anyth he s done ha made hi life ani better it reali hit a nerv not onli in derek but also in the audienc ,1,1

409,there are time when the success of a particular film depend entir on one actor s effort often a singl perform can turn what might have been a rather mediocr movi into someth worthwhil when one of these come along i usual tri to think about how mani other peopl put work into the movi that there is no way one person could possibl carri the entir project on hi shoulder but sometim there is simpli no other explan and such is the case with the hurrican thi biopic about fals convict boxer rubin hurrican carter would normal be call norman jewison s the hurrican as per the tradit of refer to a film belong to a director but though he doe decent work jewison can not claim ownership of the hurrican becaus there is one reason thi film work at all and hi name is denzel washington washington play carter a boxer who in wa convict of a late night shoot in a bar jail for year he maintain that he had never commit the crime but remain in jail after a second trial and countless appeal the situat chang when a group of canadian move to washington and work on free carter through the effort of that group and carter s lawyer he wa eventu freed when their case wa heard in feder court and the judg rule that rubin carter had been unfairli convict the film detail carter s childhood which had him in and out of jail becaus of the effort of a racist cop dan hedaya when he final got out of prison for good carter becam a rise star as a middleweight pro boxer seemingli have hi career on track until the polic frame him for multipl homicid despit the effort of polit activist and celebr he remain imprison flash forward to when lesra vicel reon shannon a young african american boy live with a group of canadian tutor read the book carter wrote while in prison the book entitl the sixteenth round open young lesra s eye to the injustic that wa carter s life and he vow to help free the incarcer boxer lesra convinc hi canadian friend deborah unger liev schreiber john hannah to work with him toward hi goal the hurrican lean on denzel washington he must carri virtual everi scene by sheer forc of will and he doe so brilliantli it s probabl accur to say that washington doe not embodi rubin carter becaus he play a charact far stronger and nobler than ani real person could hope to be it would perhap be more accur to say that washington embodi the charact of rubin carter a fiction person invent sole for the film the actor s work is master washington throw himself into everi moment refus to keep the audienc at arm s length we feel everyth he feel the humili of have to return to prison after fight so hard to make someth of hi life the pain of have to order hi wife to give up the fight and the utter despair he feel when come to the conclus that all hope is lost washington s is a perform of weight and emot depth he doesn t mere play angri happi or sad he feel it at the deepest level hi work is master and for half of thi film i realiz that the scene i wa watch would not have been nearli as affect as it wa if it had been in the hand of anoth actor norman jewison direct the film do a reason good job of pace and shot select the hurrican move quickli with no scene drawn out much further than necessari and the narr gallop along nice jewison handl hi multipl flashback well the audienc is alway awar of just what the time and place of each scene is and noth is terribl confus hi box scene construct with clear inspir from rage bull get insid the action veri well and they are believ as real sport footag jewison put togeth a particularli nice scene by util a pretti cool trick carter is sent to solitari confin for day when he refus to wear a prison uniform and jewison assist by some wonder act from a game washington show how carter gradual start to lose hi mind dure the constant solitud and eventu we get three rubin carter argu with each other in one cell jewison s best achiev in the hurrican is succeed at show how carter becom an embitt man dure hi hard knock life and how he is abl to break out of that bitter and learn to trust peopl again sadli though the film s chief failur lie with the screenplay as with most of the good but not great effort to round the pike thi winter there is much to interest a viewer in the hurrican but it seem that everi time the film get a chanc to take the most clich d rout possibl it doe take a look at the support charact for exampl who are drawn up as either entir good or entir evil carter and lesra play nice by shannon who deserv credit are the onli real peopl here everyon els is a stereotyp the canadian are good the cop are bad the canadian spend most of their time dole grin at each other in their lovey dovey commun and it is a commun despit the film s failur to make that clear while everi racist cop especi dan hedaya s melt in out of the shadow and glower at everi black person that enter the room much of the dialogu come off as rather hokey hate put me in prison love s gon na bust me out and the big courtroom climax dure which everyon get to make an impass speech could have been lift from a made for tv lifetim special it s too bad the cast is game the director doe hi job and the subject matter is interest but the script take the safer slightli more bore rout far too often i want a real reason for the cop to hold a grudg against carter other than he s a racist pig i want more evid that these canadian are real peopl with fault and virtu instead of a bunch of saintli crusad look for justic in short i want to see the film through a less distort len critic ha been levi against the liberti the hurrican take with the truth of what realli happen to carter and much of it is deserv for exampl the film give us a box scene show carter pummel defend champ joey giardello onli to be screw by the judg who rule giardello the winner most account of the fight howev have carter lose fairli furthermor much of carter s crimin past is conveni left out of the film and just whi he wa convict again in hi second trial is never realli explain of cours the hurrican work mainli as a fabl so digress from the truth can be excus at least partial but even dismiss such issu don t remov one fact the hurrican is a highli flaw film onli one actor could have made a schmaltzi predict pictur like thi work as well as it doe and it s a good thing the hurrican ha that actor carter ha been quot as say denzel

s apart and she is eager to stand by him but virgil s maladjust begin to put a strain on their relationship on the basi of the overal stori at first sight is inde a film that ha been done mani time befor and owe a great deal to it predecessor awaken what will happen throughout the film can also be easili telegraph in advanc howev what help at first sight rise abov thi predict is in the matur and intellig relationship that develop between virgil and ami usual romant pictur are of the shameless puppi dog sort the recent tom hank meg ryan starrer you ve got mail immedi pop to mind but with thi film i grew to care more about the charact and their plight the film start off notic well as ami travel up north and first meet virgil the massag sequenc were strang erot mayb even more so than the later actual love scene and as their romant involv quickli develop the film wa both entertain and sweet and there wa clearli a lot of chemistri between the two these joyou moment earli on balanc out well with the later scene in which their relationship is serious test due to a contrast in the life style that they have alway known with virgil complet use to be blind and have a comfort peac life in the countri to ami s event life in the big citi the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearli flawless perform across the board val kilmer usual cast in the macho type of role wa alway believ as a blind person and play hi charact wa probabl a littl more tricki than it appear it wa up to kilmer to not come off as someon to piti but to sympath with and he pull it off

scene set in ami s apart between she and virgil sorvino prove to be one of the most gift young actress around today and ha a flare for both comed and dramat piec kelli mcgilli who could have easili come off as the bad one dimension sister instead is also given an unexpectedli multifacet charact to play as a woman who may be overli protect but simpli care for her brother final nathan lane who is usual a littl too over the top is appropri restrain as a vision therapist the one misstep of at first sight is in it treatment of the medic procedur done on virgil veri littl is ever said or discuss

satisfyingli portray becaus of how strong the screenplay written by steve levitt is in the way it deal with the main relationship and becaus of the fabul perform from kilmer and sorvino the film s few

the pleasur of see nake salli kellerman juliann moor madelin stow even franc mcdormand and now i can add embeth davidtz who look quit healthi in the altogeth the nake actress shot ha becom as ubiquit to the altman film as the director cameo wa to the hitchcock film is it old school sexism or a clever in joke you be the judg but back to the pictur at hand in the hand of a mere mortal the gingerbread man would have been a routin thriller no better or wors than the countless other we ve all endur in the hand of a master like altman it becom an exercis in existenti doom in it own way far more success than scorses s cape fear remak which tri for the same result what may prevent it from endur with altman s greatest work is a weak third act in fact there realli is no third act in grisham s stori so it appear that altman had to throw in the hurrican just to jazz thing up but there are true moment of rivet suspens and great perform by branagh davidzt and downey jr more than enough to see you through that polygram so hate thi pictur that they tri to steal final cut from altman and then buri the market campaign when he won it back should tell you how utterli clueless of qualiti most studio are they probabl want it to look more like a time to kill and that my friend should make you veri afraid ,1,0

those earlier version in one major way it includ all of the sex and violenc spillan wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood s product code although thi take the version of i the juri closer to the core of the origin subject matter it is in thi aspect that the film receiv the most critic becaus it took thi new licens to extrem that mani argu surpass what wa in the book rest assur the movi not onli includ a great deal of nuditi but it is thoroughli violent especi toward women it featur one woman have her neck slash a set of twin forc to strip befor be stab to death by a psychot sexual deviant program by the cia judson scott and anoth woman shot point blank in the belli by hammer himself no one would deni that spillan s write ha a definit misogynist natur but the movi seem to take it a step further by give it such gloriou screen treatment it constant equat of sex and violenc much of which is play with the intent of be erot is quit unsettl it s no surpris that the movi like the book fade to black with a dead woman on the floor i the juri had a troubl product and wa not well support by the studio that made it which is one explan whi it didn t do well in theater and mani peopl have forgotten that it wa ever made the script wa written by larri cohen who is best known for hi creativ cheesi but nonetheless effect monster movi like it s aliv and it two sequel q and the stuff cohen wrote the script think he wa go to helm the project as well but he wa yank from the director s chair after onli a week s worth of shoot becaus he wa alreadi over

violenc and full frontal nuditi i the juri take on the air of a made for tv quicki with no real punch or depth but the problem in i the juri run deeper than the technic the central fault in thi updat is mike hammer whose charact wa lost in the shuffl while updat from the fifti to the eighti becaus spillan wrote all hi hammer mysteri in the first person hammer s charact is central to the tale becaus all the event are filter through hi persona we never realli get that impress in the movi there is no first person voic over narrat and some scene don t have hammer in them at all consequ a great deal of the textur of spillan s storytel is lost the period updat turn out to be a detriment bad idea becaus much of hammer s moral code is thrown to the wind despit hi character as a hard nose violent misogynist killer hammer alway stuck fervent to hi own moral code the titl itself i the juri refer to hi anti establish notion of be hi own law unlik privat eye who seek out the bad guy and

441,if there is one thing that bother me about hollywood film it s their predict end the devil s advoc ha the atyp hollywood end when everyth that should happen doe unfortun for the devil s advoc thi end nearli collaps in on itself and ruin the entir film nevertheless the film doe provid two and a half hour of pure entertain note to self kill whomev wa in charg of the preview for thi film i don t think i wa quit prepar for thi movi becaus the trailer made it appear to be some supernatur horror film about satan well it doe contain thi element but what is not mention in the ad is the other plot element and seemingli more interest one at that the devil s advoc begin in florida with an ongo trial in session kevin lomax keanu reev is the defens attorney work for a client whom ha been accus of rape a young girl he end up with a not guilti verdict despit an emot testimoni from the victim heather matarazzo he leav the courthous with hi love wife mari ann charliz theron where he is approach with an offer to travel to new york citi to help choos a good juri he accept mainli after see the paycheck he will receiv and he fli to new york with hi wife after prove hi worth for select juri and hi perfect win streak in court the head of the firm john milton al pacino ask him to work perman as a crimin lawyer he gracious accept where he is treat almost as a god he is given an incred apart which is bigger than my entir hous now and a hefti paycheck hi life seem to be on the rise and of cours hi life suddenli begin to waver and slowli declin he is attract to fellow employe christabella conni nielson and hi wife begin to feel veri lone in her larg apart mari ann take up a friendship with a neighbor who alway give advic especi if it is not want meanwhil kevin nab a case surround alexand cullen craig t nelson who appar murder three peopl he spend hour upon hour with thi case while forget hi love wife who may or may not be go insan all of thi while john milton may or may not be the devil himself after a while thing turn complet upsid down as kevin s wife claim to have seen monstrou imag superimpos on her friend a fellow employe is murder in the park and hi mother judith ivey reveal inform about kevin s real father is it all just a big nightmar or is john milton realli satan play trick with kevin s life the devil s advoc play out fairli straight forward but for some odd reason the screenwrit want to surpris everyon by give us someth we don t expect is thi surpris conclus suppos to make us feel good and go home without feel depress or disturb if so the devil s advoc mess up complet and iron i felt more depress becaus of the end as is now than i would have if it had end ten minut earli i went into the devil s advoc expect a shock horror film and that is exactli what i got i wa settl in to be disturb mental and emot and that is what i got but what wa the most disturb and horribl aspect of the movi is the poor end did i mention that i didn t like the end the produc of thi film take you on a thrill roller coaster ride and just as it is end they pull the rug out from under you film like seen and the usual suspect can surviv with thi surpris end becaus it is expect more or less we know it is go to end in an unpredict way the devil s advoc on the other hand end unpredict not from us know a lot but know noth at all if that is confus i recommend watch the film and then read that again as for the film overal i enjoy the entir first two hour be drawn in by a terrif charact studi and then ad the supernatur plot to increas the tension build from the charact studi the film run like a well built clock slowli build until final explod with a highli charg climax and an unpredict one at that and then you settl in for a nice resolut which doe not occur it wa at thi point that i felt cheat take us on a terror ride of intrigu we follow kevin lomax around as he is the centerpiec of the film everyth occur from hi perspect he is our represent on screen sort of but we are forc to wit a conclus which make most of the film seem like a game i don t want to spoil the end so all i can say is go see the film and decid for yourself perhap the most shock thing about the devil s advoc is the extrem amount of everyth it earn it r rate for a reason there is plenti of nuditi sex violenc gore and then you have gore violenc sex and more nuditi thi film realli isn t subtl about anyth show us everyth it actual surpris me that thi film did not receiv an nc rate as it is quit harsh howev the movi doe have it merit and nuditi and sex are among those i don t condon sex and nuditi in film but if it there i might as well enjoy it the biggest merit of thi film is also the most interest to watch the confront between kevin lomax and john milton are entertain but what stand out amidst thi extrem hatr is the declin of the wife mari ann portray by the extrem effect charliz theron mari ann s problem are incred intens and i found myself want to wit her declin thi may sound uncar but i want to watch becaus i felt sorri for her she is the most interest charact on the screen who is forc into a world where she is not want someth the devil s advoc contain actual shock me for reason other than extrem violenc and nuditi especi for a film of thi natur the stori actual ha someth to say about human in one of the last scene john milton explain to kevin lomax the game god play with hi children he is satan of cours he comment that it is human natur to lust and loath in vaniti then god set up rule which contradict human natur thi semi religi bash is more humor than frighten what milton say is so true about our societi that i found myself laugh out loud partial think it wa funni but patial realiz it wa true these moral dilemma are present throughout the devil s advoc give it an ad depth mani film skip over in their write but i m sure they came straight from the novel it wa base on when a film ha someth to say about our societi it deserv to be watch the cast of the devil s advoc is one of the highlight as we see memor face and they put spin on those memor face we don t expect heather matarazzo make a brief appear as the terror victim in the open court case and she doe a great job probabl the big surpris of thi film is keanu reev he ha proven himself an uneven actor success such as speed and bomb such as johnni mnemon but he

cold war fail safe usa drama minut screenplay by walter bernstein base on the novel by eugen burdick and harvey wheeler produc by max e youngstein direct by sidney lumet review by jamahl epsicokhan the most iron aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn t have a win side and a lose side in a nuclear confront everybodi lose and the aftereffect have devast effect that impact the entir world assum the world surviv the idea and perhap the onli real option is to avoid war at all cost thi is the theme of sidney lumet s fail safe a fiction drama base on the novel by eugen burdick and harvey wheeler fail safe take place dure the heart of the cold war the actual film wa releas two year after the cuban missil crisi when the unit state and the soviet union were in static discord over an issu that can be summar in a singl word commun the premis center around a combin of accid and oper flaw five u s bomber carri nuclear warhead are order to set a routin cours for moscow after an unidentifi aircraft is spot head toward america the unidentifi aircraft turn out to be a commerci airlin but a mechan failur strike the militari base that command the bomber suddenli out of contact and with stand order to remain on cours until receiv new direct the bomber pilot can not be recal and they proceed to moscow with the intent of destroy it with a nuclear strike a great deal of fail safe s plot follow variou charact as they attempt to devis way of stop the u s bomber from reach russia s border at ani cost the plot is compel and the stori creat urgenc and dread by paint the grimmest of worst case scenario the realiti set in quickli as one attempt to turn the bomber after anoth fail gener bogan frank overton take order directli from the presid of the unit state himself henri fonda is powerless the fate of the world lie in the hand of an autom pre program system that may not be stoppabl simpli becaus the creator of the war machin were too effici in their task to make a no win situat winnabl the event in fail safe are fascin becaus they re anyth but predict but the real reason fail safe work is becaus it understand more about nuclear war than what exist within the confin of it plot a key ingredi to the film is it abil to creat an ongo polem about nuclear war commun the cold war and the unit state role in all of it most of thi is through the film s use of the charact groeteschel walter matthau an arrog civilian theorist of nuclear weapon use who incident is on the presid s advis staff for analyz the statist plausibl of wage a nuclear war mani of the film s most point messag aris from discuss where groeteschel is one of the key voic earli in the film he host a dinner parti where he explain the import of strategi in a nuclear assault to minim casualti what s the differ between million and million dead a guest ask impati forti million groeteschel respond wryli the problem with groeteschel s mindset is that he believ nuclear combat to be a viabl method of war the onli differ to him between nuclear armageddon and convent warfar is the raw data and the casualti total groeteschel realiz that these weapon can destroy the world sever time over yet hi answer to the arm race is not to slow down and tri to cool the situat off as gener black dan o herlihi ha often recommend on the contrari accord to groeteschel that would lead to russia have more nuclear weapon than the u s which would clearli put america at a disadvantag such a stanc wa perhap the central paradox and misguid practic of the arm race fail safe clearli see it as one of the central issu of the cold war and likewis it becom a central theme in the film whi continu to build such machin of mass destruct while alreadi possess enough of them to destroy the world sever time over is it wise is it even logic no not realli although fail safe is more about the issu of nuclear weapon than it is about the polit ramif of commun there is a scene in the film that deal with commun in an intent superfici one side sort of way again thi is achiev through groeteschel who is easili the film s most import charact in term of the larger theme signific in addit to provid the central pro nuclear war voic that the film warn against he also make key remark about communist that show just how much fear and resent peopl of the period were prone to when it came to commun the context the film use suggest that thi hatr wa often glib one of groeteschel s logic train of thought ventur so far into fantasi theoret predict that it s mere absurd he label the averag marxist an unfeel calcul machin that will do whatev it take to preserv itself groeteschel take it so far as to say that if the u s drop the warhead on moscow the soviet will instantli surrend for to retali would invit counter measur that would further destroy russia s home soil which must be preserv at all cost groeteschel seem to forget these peopl are human be with emot gener black quickli remind him that the soviet would attack out of reveng as ani normal person would the ironi here is groeteschel s own mechan theoriz he is so quick to judg the enemi that he doesn t even realiz hi own seemingli program thought pattern onc the film make it evid that turn the u s bomber will be imposs the question becom what the consequ of destroy moscow will be just how will the soviet union s leader react and what can the presid do to convey hi best intent just how doe one pass off the death of million of peopl as an mishap with the help of hi translat buck larri hagman the presid negoti at length with the soviet leader in scene that prove amazingli taut and power in their simplic with lumet s long take of fonda and hagman in the same frame exchang the dialog between the presid and the soviet leader without get into too much detail i will say that the compromis they ultim reach is veri costli yet necessari and as sensibl as possibl under the circumst that is as sensibl as a nuclear incid can probabl be it doe accomplish what it must it avoid an all out war someth that simpli isn t possibl becaus of it all too real consequ dramat the end is quit power and the use of o herlihi s charact as the symbol matador provid a bookend to the film by end the stori while tie into hi dream sequenc from the film s open is particularli appropri fail safe is a product of a major hollywood studio releas by columbia pictur and it ha the structur of a high tension suspens thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film nevertheless under lumet s direct and walter bernstein s intellig adapt of burdick s and wheeler s novel the film continu to have a last effect even after the event on screen have unfold the film often warn that the autom of war is someth that may make nuclear holocaust an unintent consequ of such mass arm but it wa the consciou human choic to initi thi automat arm that fail safe also find danger in retrospect the arm race seem to be one of the most puzzl exercis in futil of the centuri it s just fortun that both side were final abl to come to their sens and slow down rather than continu groeteschel s danger approach of speed up and caus a possibl meltdown ,1,1

coeur en hiver in the tradit howev the film is incred success in it passion dramat of a passion deni protagonist stephan daniel auteuil stephan daniel auteuil is a master violin maker he is passionless about all that which surround him except hi craft and the music which hi craft is respons for produc even the relationship between he and hi boss maxim andr dussolli is a control and almost manipul associ highlight by the fact that stephan permit maxim to win close squash match in the begin of the movi stephan is a close solitari individu and the audienc is care left to wonder about the depth of emot behind thi enigmat man camil kessler emmanuel beart is a master violinist and the new love of maxim maxim is so much in love with camil that he plan to and doe leav hi wife like stephan camil is outwardli veri control and reserv sacrif all thought and emot to her violin and the music which emerg when stephan and camil meet there is a recognit of a bond by both individu howev wherea camil submit to the wild interplay of emot which she now feel for stephan stephan onli admit that camil is attract to him stephan ignor hi feel for camil which the audienc can not help but to see is present as the movi progress the two charact becom more and more polar in their view and emot for one anoth these two peopl with veri similar approach to life initi react to their new circumst veri differ stephan becom even more ration and control while camil becom more tempestu until she almost border on suffer a nervou breakdown due to the inabl to consumm their relationship howev their approach to each other is perhap not surpris consid their vocat the audienc is led to believ that stephan may have been a geniu as a violinist as well due to hi relationship with a master violin teacher howev appar he could not be a violinist due to hi intoler for flaw in hi play consequ stephan becom a precis craftsmen with the instrument and no longer play in contrast camil had almost given the violin year earlier howev with the aid of her manag she ha progress to be almost one of the world s finest success submerg herself to her play dure the cours of the movi we see both charact evolv as they struggl to meet the challeng of their new emot stephan attempt to remain unchang howev we do see subtl hint of hi transform one of the most obviou is when he defeat maxim in squash the develop of all of the charact mani of which is not includ in thi synopsi is incred american movi with rare except have not and i would daresay can not approach foreign film in charact develop in it essenc thi movi is about the develop and growth of the charact camil and stephan the portray of all the other charact in the movi includ a death is to further the develop of camil s and stepahn s charact i am not sure whi berardinelli say at time it becom difficult to determin whether stephan should be piti or vilifi and it is to auteuil s credit that he manag to maintain thi uncertainti thi movi is not about judg stephan s action as be right or wrong but about view their growth and accept the charact as who they are i find the end appropri unfortun i found the last ten minut which led up to the final scene to be veri unfulfil thi portion of the film is where the sens of closur could have been success accomplish unfortun there is a hurri and almost a soap opera type surg of emot from all of the charact while ravel may not be quit as accomplish as schubert or mozart ravel ha hi day in thi film the synerg of the tension of ravel s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen the direct in thi movi is wonder the actor and actress are excel each play their part with great sincer and warmth emmanuel beart s person is beauti and needless to say i must say that emmanuel beart herself is beauti besid the near end the onli other critic of the movi which i have is that the movi is almost too cerebr i almost left with the sens littl happen becaus almost all the chang which occur in the movi happen in deep in their psych and littl in their person or the situat which they end as part of the one question which i am left with is while they have accept their lot ha their attitud toward love chang i have sever possibl which i believ the movi hint at but i am unsur of which the director is espous in summari thi movi is sole about the charact growth of two charact who almost develop a relationship in the process we see their attitud toward life and other peopl in itself i do not believ un coeur is a complic movi where it doe becom complic is when we juxtapos the scene of the movi into the greater walk of life where we as american have preconceiv american notion of relationship love and peopl i do wonder how the movi translat when view within it nativ french cultur howev i bring my american preconcept enjoy the film i would welcom ani comment about thi movi from ani who have seen it ,1,1

524,peopl who enjoy scienc fiction are often face with unpleas surpris due to the improp label of novel stori comic book or movi often scienc fiction aficionado find materi previous label as scienc fiction to be pure fantasi or supernatur horror or rather simpl techno thriller in such case mistak are understand genr boundari are never clearli mark but i believ there are realli few case when a movi label as scienc fiction actual happen to be straight histor epic such thing occur in former yugoslavia some fifteen year ago when nation distributor gave such treatment to the right stuff film direct by philip kaufman the mistak of the distributor could be explain with the fact that the offici poster of the film featur men in space suit but the right stuff film isn t even fiction it wa base on the non fiction book by tom wolf cover the earli year of american space program the plot of the film begin in when few peopl heard of edward air forc base major test site for experiment plane the major aim of test flight is to determin abil of man aircraft to reach mach speed and thu break the sound barrier mani pilot tri to achiev that goal and mani paid with their live for such bravado but one quiet pilot chuck eager play by sam shape succe and thu give exampl for whole new gener of test pilot determin to enter histori book by break new speed record ten year later soviet have launch sputnik mark the begin of the space age in order to regain nation prestig us govern decid to be the first to send man into space best air forc navi and marin pilot are recruit into program but not yeager becaus he lack colleg educ and desir all american imag in one of critic poll the right stuff wa name as one among top film made in s such high posit could be explain with the fact that kaufman s film look quit atyp for it time with more than three hour of length and epic scope it look more suitabl for s and s age when hollywood use to make film larger than life but the real reason lie in the fact that it wa made by truli remark and talent filmmak philip kaufman creat reput in s by use all the opportun of that golden age in order to creat origin memor movi the right stuff wa the last of them swan song of an era when produc allow director to spend big buck on unusu risk take artsi project the right stuff is unusu becaus it lack mani standard element of hollywood film the plot is almost non exist and not veri coher the stori featur mani interest incid and anecdot shift focu from the old gener of test pilot embodi in yeager to new gener of the astronaut the film also lack convent protagonist yeager who also appear in small cameo remain the true hero of the film but equal time and exposur is also given to other astronaut and their wive make thi movi into ensembl piec that gave opportun for kaufman to use multitud of great act talent until that specialis onli for bit or charact role sam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achiev breech of the sound barrier remain obscur in histori book probabl due to hi own modesti on the surfac he lack person compar with hi hype and more fortun astronaut colleagu but shepard give textur to thi charact with subtl gestur and phrase shepard s perform is follow with great act by ed harri as clean cut marin and futur politician john glenn young denni quaid is more than fine as arrog fighter jock gordo cooper and thi arrog is mirror in hi friend and most tragic figur of virgil grissom superbl play by fred ward alway reliabl charact actor scott glenn provid some comic relief as navi aviat and arguabl first american man in space alan shepard kaufman left room for femal talent to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mari jo deschanel are great as pilot wive royal dano is also impress as menac figur of preacher but the most memor perform belong to donald moffat as vice presid lyndon b johnson and jane dornack as nurs murch great act talent assembl for thi film wa mirror with kaufman s superb direct most notabl of all is the method kaufman use in order to suggest the passag of time the begin of the film show test pilot live in the middl of desert as virtual unknown far away from strict rule and disciplin everyth seem natur yeager can indulg himself in hors ride just few yard away from the fastest and most preciou aircraft in the world in that set it s quit normal for import technic problem to be solv with simpl chainsaw and for the test pilot not to report their rib be broken befor most import flight but the time are chang ww allianc with ussr is replac with cold war and natur pilot like yeager must be replac with more disciplin convent pilot their entir live becom focu of media frenzi and their job is subject to strict rule meticul plan and they must fight the bureaucrat public seek politician and uncar scientist like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun play by scott beach onli to preserv their most basic human digniti thi contrast is underlin with the beauti edit sequenc while yeager conduct hi final and most spectacular test flight in absolut obscur mercuri astronaut receiv fame and fortun although some of them even befor go in the space those contrast and similar effect are achiev with kaufman s superb use of poetic movi languag edit is great and photographi by caleb deschanel provid mani memor scene like the funer in the desert or astronaut in their suit walk in slow motion the same imag would be copi in mani latter film although kaufman enjoy support of nasa and american militari which provid authent locat and period equip he still had to use special effect in order to simul space flight those effect are excel and they can still fool the audienc accustom to cgi and real footag of earth from outer space anoth fine contribut of thi film is oscar award music score by bill conti i still trembl from excit everi time i hear it it is accompani with the use of holst and debussi some of the song use in the background also provid authent atmospher of the histor period thi film is great and it cult statu is well deserv but there are some minor flaw some of the mercuri astronaut aren t flesh out enough although be play by fine actor like lanc henriksen film also lack proper closur on the other hand most logic conclus of the film land on the moon would requir thi film to be more than six hour long also some critic were prone to attack thi film as too amerocentr and hard on russian who were portray as evil monster just in line with most virul cold war rhetor of reagan s america in some of contemporari interview kaufman defend that approach by claim that he want to make film as authent as possibl and in order to do that he portray russian not as they were in real life but as they were perceiv by american in earli s time ha pass now we don t see astronaut as hero in thi age of widespread satellit commun and routin space mission those men and women in space suit are seen as mere mainten worker few young boy want to be astronaut when they grow up but thi film sentiment remind of the time when futur began perhap could encourag at least some of them to follow mercuri astronaut footstep seek new frontier in the sky and even if they decid to stay on earth they could still appreci the right stuff as an extraordinari piec of cinema ,1,1

it stori and shock by everi singl turn that occur i prefer film like these becaus these are what the best kind of film are like i don t realli feel there are to be ani real rule for cinema a film can do anyth as long as it make it work but i do ask that all film have one thing in common they creat experi when i watch a film no matter what kind of film it is i want to be abl to take certain memori along with me the celebr is great becaus it s chock full of those it creat a world so complet realist that everyth that occur is as memor as the littl instanc of life that catch your attent and stay with you for the rest of your life and then it make thing just a tad bit farscial just to make sure you re pay attent which you are becaus what transpir is just so goddam interest that if you were to ever feel bore then you re of your attent span need a bit of a tune up the stori take place at the extravag home of an age patriarch hen mortizen who ha just turn and is have a parti thrown for him all hi friend and famili turn up and for the first half hour we get introduc to everyon simplist and realist no aggravatingli condescend pose for the camera deal here the eldest son christian ulrich thomsen look a bit like a young malcolm mcdowel is the first to be seen in the film walk to hi father s home hi brother michael thoma bo larsen drive by pull over greet him then kick hi famili out of the car forc them to walk to the estat just so christian can be comfort we then meet helen paprika steen their sister a woman who alway seem to be stress out who invit the driver of her car gbatokai dakinah an american to to come join her at the parti she s go to onc they re all there and settl in the parti begin and as custom the eldest son ha to make a speech to hi dad so christian stand up at the head of the tabl and reveal the film s punchlin hi father rape all hi children at a young age but sinc thi is a famili friend affair hi confess becom more detest than the suppos truth and is simpli brush off despit hi effort and what transpir is sorta like jerri springer cross with jean renoir and it s all terribl interest to watch twist occur and soon the film ha taken on a nearli farsic natur but still seem realist becaus the peopl involv realli feel like they could reach such end the most notori thing about thi film which ha been get the most notic though is that the director thoma vinterberg ha shot it in a complet awkward fashion as a member of the danish filmmak clan dogm a group that ha vow to oppos the auteur concept make up illus and dramaturg predict so that they may purg film so that onc again the inner live of the charact justifi the plot i have not seen break the wave the other notabl film by a member of thi group lar von trier to be exact but the celebr work exquisit in thi depart it feel like realiti like you re actual watch real peopl and not actor and as a major pointer ha been shot on video as a result it look more like the home movi you never dare shot of your famili than an actual film but alway want to we see key moment in peopl s live that they wouldn t dare show to the world and it captur the farscial comedi of life so accur and acut that thi style as iron showmanship as it realli is work perfectli for the natur of the film the key though to thi film and the reason it s not just a cool danish import is becaus thi film is not about reveal the truth as much as it is about the way peopl react to such an explos truth throughout the film we see a complet realiz debat over the truth and the effect it ha on the live of those who have learn to live with lie a debat so three dimension that it could easili blow oliv stone and hi the truth at all cost reason out of the water of cours it wa not right for the father to rape hi children and of cours they couldn t have fought back then and of cours thi ha creat scar suppress insid them and ye it s thearapeut for one to releas the truth year later when they know it could easili destroy the one who emot destroy them earlier but then again the father after all is not a total bad guy and we can see the emot complic that aris thank to a perform by mortizen which is just so great and touch that while we do believ that he could have rape hi children year earlier we also see a man who ha also learn to live with what he s done and deep down feel true guilt that is onli now begin to surfac the final scene involv mortizen and everyon els is utterli devast thank to him and thomsen whose perform is utterli flawless and equal emot complex everyon els is flawless as well the actor never seem to be step into the shoe of their charact as much as they do walk comfort in them the actor or writer have not made the mistak to judg these charact in the slightest there are no white or

546,i think the first thing thi review should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x file first let me assur you that no prior experi with the seri is requir to fulli enjoy thi movi the produc are not stupid make a movi just for fan of the seri is not profit you have to reach for a larger audienc therefor the movi is quit user friendli altough non fan will onli fail to understand certain emot behind the look mani charact exchang but fear not duchovni and anoth man later on provid more than adequ background info on what is go on you will never feel as if you just walk in on the third act of some great opera in ani case the answer is no i am not a fan of the x file i onli watch it when noth els is on and i prefer millennium howev sinc the fox network as been so kind as to air sever key episod for sever week befor the movi s open weekend i took that opportun to test the movi i tape all of these episod and watch them onli after se the movi i am glad to report that i learn noth new everyth you need to know is explain to the viewer by duchovni and other i know i am go mayb a bit too far to make my point but everybodi should get the chanc to experi thi movi warn major spoiler follow pleas do not read to fulli enjoy thi movi you must not be abl know what is come what exactli is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warn the x file is what a summer should be excit scari great special effect unlik other summer movi the effect do not take over the movi and are onli there when it is realli necessari and good perform thi is come from a guy who think david duchovni is the human equival of a wooden plank from start to finish thi movi doe not let go of you when i compar it with last summer s movi the best way to describ it would be take the excit and great score from face off and the deadli use of sound from event horizon thi flick is scari not in a b movi kind of way where you alway know where and when the critter will jump at our hero in fact the first time the critter in thi movi make an apper it is total out of the blue you might as well bring ear plug becaus thi thing is louuuudd the last time a monster scare me that much wa when i first saw alien as a six year old kid you know when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor becaus the creatur might be under the chair or when you keep tri to cover your throat with your shirt so yeah the x file is scari and guess what you never even have to see the monster but your imagin work overtim and it sure beat have to watch a flaw comput gener babyzilla it look like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undi type of monster do not think that the x file is a monster movi in fact the creatur is there for mayb three minut total no the x file is defin a mulder episod of the seri sculli is at hi side of cours but gillian anderson get mayb half the screen time she ha a coupl of good scene with duchovni but she get kidnap dure the last half hour of the movi so she doe not get to do much no thi is mulder s time in the spotlight by now you have heard of the scene where mulder shower independ day if you have not then i will not spoil it for you let s just say that due to recent event mulder should be shower godzilla instead to those of you wonder if mulder discov that the truth is inde out there who care if he did find it the seri would over anyway so what are you complain about the dialogu in interest and the director is marvel the camera is almost alway look over the shoulder of our hero so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill the script is spotless everi thing that happen happen for a purpos if you are confus by someth do not worri becaus it will all becom clear later on but and i can not stress thi enough pay attent unlik most summer movi the dialogu is twice as import as the effect miss one vital piec of inform and like most peopl who talk dure movi you will go home and tell all your friend how thi movi made no sens also to those peopl who need to go to the bathroom dure movi don t the person who watch the movi with me had to go twice and twice she miss an import convers there is no time to take a breather between scene becaus again unlik most summer movi godzilla anybodi the x file doe not need to fill scene between the suspens and the action with useless subplot everi scene is crucial and serv a purpos who need to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emot scene between godzilla attack so far thi summer i have seen onli one movi who rank higher on my list of movi i d recommend and that is the truman show but it onli win by a nose but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movi the x file is what more do you ask from a summer movi other than the chanc to be excit cool effect it s good some puls pound hell ye strang enough i think that fan of the seri will hate thi movi while non fan will have a good time it doe not provid answer to the show s mani question the statu quo remain nearli the same and no mulder and sculli do not get togeth rate four and a half out of five star for the best movi yet thi summer sever jump right out of your seat thrill mani whoah i never saw that one come moment four holi shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an end you may wonder where thi movi lost half a star well i swore never to give a movi the full five star so i had to find someth about the in hi ice truck the track it leav in the snow behind him go on for sever mile but then they just stop it s pretti obviou the film s

592,much ballyhoo ha been made over thi new version of lolita made in a time when one would think that a faith adapt of the infam novel could be made over it use of pedophilia and as such it s import to address it straight forwardli befor ani other ideal such as good and theme can be discuss as thi film ha been in film limbo for a number of year lie around in vault san a distributor and have critic wait to either hail it a masterpiec or call it anticlimact horseshit when see thi film after all the hoopla keep in mind that there are peopl name me who are fan of the novel who have been eagerli await thi flick sinc it creation well you just have to wonder whi no one realli pick it up for distribut what s even wors is that see thi lolita especi the first time and if you re familiar with anyth lolita is admittingli veri anticlimact thi is a real piti becaus when you realli sit down to watch thi film ignor all the crap that ha preceed it it s realli quit a film perhap the best film by director adrian lyne although realli look at it competit flashdanc fatal attract and indec propos at least besid jacob s ladder i ve seen thi lolita twice the first time i wasn t so blown away it seem overli dramat and surprisingli unaffect the second time not realli think about how i ve wait for what seem like forev to see it and how i m see it on a tv set on a premium cabl channel and not a giant movi theatr it realli affect me emot the stori itself is a surprisingli heartbreak one which is whi it s such a good novel and whi thi is such a good film the stori of a pedophil obsess with a young year old girl name dolor a k a lolita is great becaus it s not trash for the pervert but becaus it s about human obsess with thing that are out of one s reach it protagonist the comic name humbert humbert is not your averag pedophil but a serious wound human be who embodi how we are all destroy by our sick obsess and idosyncrasi the charact of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden appl in christian mytholog someth that will destroy us but that we can t live without these idea are all work into thi film nice but done in a way that is not heavi hand at all but instead lyric and emot devast the focu of thi film and the reason for make it it seem wa to realli penetr the emot depth of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beauti dramat imag and scene which are blatantli over styliz the tone of the book is a comic one but it s also a tragic one and humbert tell the stori from hi perspect blow everi singl thing out of perspect humbert exist in a fantsi world of hi obsess and desir and thi reflect the way the entir film ha been design we get a sens that perhap it s by do thi that humbert ha realli trap himself into a fate that will ultim leav him haggard and destroy he weep uncontrol and never let himself get over hi origin year old love and allow himself to embodi her as lolita he let hi feel for her navig all hi decis and by the end he ha noth but overli dramat feel for her the stori recogn the extrem of thi almost out of a test see if the reader will realli sympath with someon who is social deem a pervert and one almost wonder while read the book if the author vladimir nabokov wrote the book as a mean to bring into focu hi own sick obsess and perhap bring them to peac the weirdest thing about thi film is that by the end when humbert ha reach the final of hi obsession journey we can easili sympath and even identifi with him the open and final imag of the film are the same and who hasn t done a similar action that is wander about without ani sens of realiti or anyth els but a deep sad in us thi is the second time the novel ha been adapt for the screen the first time be film in shock by stanley kubrick who couldn t possibl have brought the novel to the screen with as much faith as lyne ha been abl to do but did the next best thing he econom for everyth and came up with a droll black comedi about obsess in gener in that film he use the trap of societi as benefit the studio demand the final scene that of a heinou murder come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murder and second as a pedophil and when you see it it give the film depth of a man trap by obsess the censor wouldn t allow anymor than a coupl glanc and subtl dialogu to show the um relationship between humbert and lolita so kubrick decid to play it as comedi but still allow the tragedi to seep through look at these two version especi after read the novel and we all know that when we ve read a novel and see a film adapt we are bound to be anger by ani size differ it s realli imposs to compar them they both go for differ thing and one ha a lot more room to be as sexual frank as the novel wa and although it s true that sever scene are similar and are thu up for comparison overal it s unfair to say which one is better and which one is wors i have never been one for say the level of great of a film adapt of a novel is deem by how faith it is and i won t say that here howev thi film is pretti amaz mostli becaus hey i love the book and thi film nearli remind me of it it doesn t have nearli as much wit a coupl comic scene and even a lot of good chuckl but just not total witti but it doe have the same emot toll that the novel had some of that is in the cast of the two lead jeremi iron with hi deep soft british voic and gentl look is an amaz humbert he s droll in a veri uniqu way and well no one can look distraught the way he doe he bring a wonder sympathi to the role that goe beyond patho and realli come up as be easi to identifi with the audienc and when he look at lolita with love and she look at him with lust you know that he s her prison for as long as he live and dominiqu swain who play the titl charact is rather incred she pull off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the origin wonder balanc the qualiti of seduct brati and self centered that mark the charact it s easi to see whi she surrend to humbert she love the attent and know that she can have her way with him at ani time when he deni her someth she blackmail him effortlessli a scene involv a rock chair and a littl foot action is damn near classic and when he stand up to her she weep and run away leav humbert to follow her there are two other minor charact in the film one who s a road block in the begin and the other who s a reappear threat to the relationship the former is charlott lolita s mother play by melani griffith in the book charlott is a monster of a woman overbear constantli scold her child overli religi and ultim selfish and she s the one obstacl humbert ha to overcom to obtain hi goal at least in the begin as play by shelli winter in the origin she repres all these qualiti as play by griffith here she s about half of them it s annoy to watch a film and play a game where you tri to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mention the actor who play them first and even though griffith is not realli bad persay she s noth more the other is clare quilti the writer who is also tri to seduc lolita and succe but at a price langella take a total differ direct than the one peter sellar took in the origin quilti wa a comic charact in the origin a threat in the form of mani form pop in state of rambl german prone and eventu drunk langella take the other rout allow all of the creepi to be unearth and the result is a charact who exist in shadow and low shot and who meet a wonder iron end the exact opposit of what we thought of him as you can see most of these are not improv or mistak done on the part of lyne and hi screenwrit stephen schiff but just part of a whole new look at the novel at least cinema wise thi version is beauti and perpetu sadden the camera movement are styliz and each shot is breathtakingli rich the act is for the most part wonder and when we watch it we realli get a sens that for humbert who is tell the stori the onli
